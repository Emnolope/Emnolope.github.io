the Author</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Introduction</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Stop
me if you’ve heard this one before. Bril iant col ege kids sit ing
in a dorm are inventing the future. Heedless of boundaries, possessed
of new technology and youthful enthusiasm, they build a new company
from scratch. Their early success al ows them to raise money and
bring an amazing new product to market. They hire their friends,
assemble a superstar team, and dare the world to stop them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Ten
years and several startups ago, that was me, building my rst company.
I particularly remember a moment from back then: the moment I
realized my company was going to fail. My cofounder and I were at our
wits’ end. The dot-com bubble had burst, and we had spent al our
money. We tried desperately to raise more capital, and we could not.
It was like a breakup scene from a Hol ywood movie: it was raining,
and we were arguing in the street. We couldn’t even agree on where
to walk next, and so we parted in anger, heading in opposite
directions. As a metaphor for our company’s failure, this image of
the two of us, lost in the rain and drifting apart, is perfect.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
remains a painful memory. The company limped along for months
afterward, but our situation was hopeless. At the time, it had seemed
we were doing everything right: we had a great product, a bril iant
team, amazing technology, and the right idea at the right time. And
we real y were on to something. We were building a way for col ege
kids to create online pro les for the purpose of sharing … with
employers. Oops. But despite a promising idea, we were nonetheless
doomed from day one, because we did not know the process we would
need to use to turn</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	because
we did not know the process we would need to use to turn our product
insights into a great company.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
you’ve never experienced a failure like this, it is hard to
describe the feeling. It’s as if the world were fal ing out from
under you. You realize you’ve been duped. The stories in the
magazines are lies: hard work and perseverance don’t lead to
success. Even worse, the many, many, many promises you’ve made to
employees, friends, and family are not going to come true. Everyone
who thought you were foolish for stepping out on your own wil be
proven right.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
wasn’t supposed to turn out that way. In magazines and newspapers,
in blockbuster movies, and on countless blogs, we hear the mantra of
the successful entrepreneurs: through determination, bril iance,
great timing, and—above al —a great product, you too can achieve
fame and fortune.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
is a mythmaking industry hard at work to sel us that story, but I
have come to believe that the story is false, the product of
selection bias and after-the-fact rationalization. In fact, having
worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs, I have seen rsthand how often
a promising start leads to failure. The grim reality is that most
startups fail. Most new products are not successful. Most new
ventures do not live up to their potential.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Yet
the story of perseverance, creative genius, and hard work persists.
Why is it so popular? I think there is something deeply appealing
about this modern-day rags-to-riches story. It makes success seem
inevitable if you just have the right stu . It means that the mundane
details, the boring stu , the smal individual choices don’t mat er.
If we build it, they wil come. When we fail, as so many of us do, we
have a ready-made excuse: we didn’t have the right stu . We weren’t
visionary enough or weren’t in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	After
more than ten years as an entrepreneur, I came to reject that line of
thinking. I have learned from both my own successes and failures and
those of many others that it’s the boring stu that mat ers the
most. Startup success is not a consequence of good genes or being in
the right place at the right time. Startup success can be engineered
by fol owing the right process, which means it</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	can
be engineered by fol owing the right process, which means it can be
learned, which means it can be taught.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Entrepreneurship
is a kind of management. No, you didn’t read that wrong. We have
wildly divergent associations with these two words, entrepreneurship
and management. Lately, it seems that one is cool, innovative, and
exciting and the other is dul , serious, and bland. It is time to
look past these preconceptions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Let
me tel you a second startup story. It’s 2004, and a group of
founders have just started a new company. Their previous company had
failed very publicly. Their credibility is at an al -time low. They
have a huge vision: to change the way people communicate by using a
new technology cal ed avatars (remember, this was before James
Cameron’s blockbuster movie). They are fol owing a visionary named
Wil Harvey, who paints a compel ing picture: people connecting with
their friends, hanging out online, using avatars to give them a
combination of intimate connection and safe anonymity. Even bet er,
instead of having to build al the clothing, furniture, and
accessories these avatars would need to accessorize their digital
lives, the customers would be enlisted to build those things and sel
them to one another.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
engineering chal enge before them is immense: creating virtual
worlds, user-generated content, an online commerce engine,
micropayments, and—last but not least—the three-dimensional
avatar technology that can run on anyone’s PC.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I’m
in this second story, too. I’m a cofounder and chief technology o
cer of this company, which is cal ed IMVU. At this point in our
careers, my cofounders and I are determined to make new mistakes.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
do everything wrong: instead of spending years perfecting our
technology, we build a minimum viable product, an early product that
is terrible, ful of bugs and crash-your-computer-yes-real y stability
problems. Then we ship it to customers way before it’s ready. And
we charge money for it. After securing initial customers, we change
the product constantly—much too fast by traditional
standards—shipping new versions of our product dozens of times
every single day.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
real y did have customers in those early days—true visionary early
adopters—and we often talked to them and asked for their</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	early
adopters—and we often talked to them and asked for their feedback.
But we emphatical y did not do what they said. We viewed their input
as only one source of information about our product and overal
vision. In fact, we were much more likely to run experiments on our
customers than we were to cater to their whims.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Traditional
business thinking says that this approach shouldn’t work, but it
does, and you don’t have to take my word for it. As you’l see
throughout this book, the approach we pioneered at IMVU has become
the basis for a new movement of entrepreneurs around the world. It
builds on many previous management and product development ideas,
including lean manufacturing, design thinking, customer development,
and agile development. It represents a new approach to creating
continuous innovation. It’s cal ed the Lean Startup.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Despite
the volumes writ en on business strategy, the key at ributes of
business leaders, and ways to identify the next big thing, innovators
stil struggle to bring their ideas to life. This was the frustration
that led us to try a radical new approach at IMVU, one characterized
by an extremely fast cycle time, a focus on what customers want
(without asking them), and a scienti c approach to making decisions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>ORIGINS
OF THE LEAN STARTUP</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
am one of those people who grew up programming computers, and so my
journey to thinking about entrepreneurship and management has taken a
circuitous path. I have always worked on the product development side
of my industry; my partners and bosses were managers or marketers,
and my peers worked in engineering and operations. Throughout my
career, I kept having the experience of working incredibly hard on
products that ultimately failed in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	At
rst, largely because of my background, I viewed these as technical
problems that required technical solutions: bet er architecture, a
bet er engineering process, bet er discipline, focus, or</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	architecture,
a bet er engineering process, bet er discipline, focus, or product
vision. These supposed xes led to stil more failure. So I read
everything I could get my hands on and was blessed to have had some
of the top minds in Silicon Val ey as my mentors. By the time I
became a cofounder of IMVU, I was hungry for new ideas about how to
build a company.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
was fortunate to have cofounders who were wil ing to experiment with
new approaches. They were fed up—as I was—by the failure of
traditional thinking. Also, we were lucky to have Steve Blank as an
investor and adviser. Back in 2004, Steve had just begun preaching a
new idea: the business and marketing functions of a startup should be
considered as important as engineering and product development and
therefore deserve an equal y rigorous methodology to guide them. He
cal ed that methodology Customer Development, and it o ered insight
and guidance to my daily work as an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Meanwhile,
I was building IMVU’s product development team, using some of the
unorthodox methods I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Measured
against the traditional theories of product development I had been
trained on in my career, these methods did not make sense, yet I
could see rsthand that they were working. I struggled to explain the
practices to new employees, investors, and the founders of other
companies. We lacked a common language for describing them and
concrete principles for understanding them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
began to search outside entrepreneurship for ideas that could help me
make sense of my experience. I began to study other industries,
especial y manufacturing, from which most modern theories of
management derive. I studied lean manufacturing, a process that
originated in Japan with the Toyota Production System, a completely
new way of thinking about the manufacturing of physical goods. I
found that by applying ideas from lean manufacturing to my own
entrepreneurial chal enges—with a few tweaks and changes—I had
the beginnings of a framework for making sense of them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
line of thought evolved into the Lean Startup: the application of
lean thinking to the process of innovation.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	IMVU
became a tremendous success. IMVU customers have</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	IMVU
became a tremendous success. IMVU customers have created more than 60
mil ion avatars. It is a pro table company with annual revenues of
more than $50 mil ion in 2011, employing more than a hundred people
in our current o ces in Mountain View, California. IMVU’s virtual
goods catalog—which seemed so risky years ago—now has more than 6
mil ion items in it; more than 7,000 are added every day, almost al
created by customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
a result of IMVU’s success, I began to be asked for advice by other
startups and venture capitalists. When I would describe my
experiences at IMVU, I was often met with blank stares or extreme
skepticism. The most common reply was “That could never work!”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	My
experience so ew in the face of conventional thinking that most
people, even in the innovation hub of Silicon Val ey, could not wrap
their minds around it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Then
I started to write, rst on a blog cal ed Startup Lessons Learned, and
speak—at conferences and to companies, startups, and venture
capitalists—to anyone who would listen. In the process of being cal
ed on to defend and explain my insights and with the col aboration of
other writers, thinkers, and entrepreneurs, I had a chance to re ne
and develop the theory of the Lean Startup beyond its rudimentary
beginnings. My hope al along was to nd ways to eliminate the
tremendous waste I saw al around me: startups that built products
nobody wanted, new products pul ed from the shelves, countless dreams
unrealized.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Eventual
y, the Lean Startup idea blossomed into a global movement.
Entrepreneurs began forming local in-person groups to discuss and
apply Lean Startup ideas. There are now organized communities of
practice in more than a hundred cities around the world.1 My travels
have taken me across countries and continents.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Everywhere
I have seen the signs of a new entrepreneurial renaissance. The Lean
Startup movement is making entrepreneurship accessible to a whole new
generation of founders who are hungry for new ideas about how to
build successful companies.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Although
my background is in high-tech software entrepreneurship, the movement
has grown way beyond those</p>

the movement has grown way beyond those roots. Thousands of
entrepreneurs are put ing Lean Startup principles to work in every
conceivable industry. I’ve had the chance to work with
entrepreneurs in companies of al sizes, in di erent industries, and
even in government. This journey has taken me to places I never
imagined I’d see, from the world’s most elite venture
capitalists, to Fortune 500 boardrooms, to the Pentagon.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
most nervous I have ever been in a meeting was when I was at empting
to explain Lean Startup principles to the chief information o cer of
the U.S. Army, who is a three-star general (for the record, he was
extremely open to new ideas, even from a civilian like me).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Pret
y soon I realized that it was time to focus on the Lean Startup
movement ful time. My mission: to improve the success rate of new
innovative products worldwide. The result is the book you are

LEAN STARTUP METHOD</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is a book for entrepreneurs and the people who hold them accountable.
The ve principles of the Lean Startup, which inform al three parts of
this book, are as fol ows: 1. Entrepreneurs are everywhere. You don’t
have to work in a garage to be in a startup. The concept of
entrepreneurship includes anyone who works within my de nition of a
startup: a human institution designed to create new products and
services under conditions of extreme uncertainty. That means
entrepreneurs are everywhere and the Lean Startup approach can work
in any size company, even a very large enterprise, in any sector or
industry.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
Entrepreneurship is management. A startup is an institution, not just
a product, and so it requires a new kind of management speci cal y
geared to its context of extreme uncertainty. In fact, as I wil argue
later, I believe “entrepreneur” should be considered a</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	wil
argue later, I believe “entrepreneur” should be considered a job
title in al modern companies that depend on innovation for their
future growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
Validated learning. Startups exist not just to make stu , make money,
or even serve customers. They exist to learn how to build a
sustainable business. This learning can be validated scienti cal y by
running frequent experiments that al ow entrepreneurs to test each
element of their vision.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	4.
Build-Measure-Learn. The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn
ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn
whether to pivot or persevere. Al successful startup processes should
be geared to accelerate that feedback loop.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	5.
Innovation accounting. To improve entrepreneurial outcomes and hold
innovators accountable, we need to focus on the boring stu : how to
measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize
work. This requires a new kind of accounting designed for
startups—and the people who hold them accountable.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Why
Startups Fail</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Why
are startups failing so badly everywhere we look?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
rst problem is the al ure of a good plan, a solid strategy, and
thorough market research. In earlier eras, these things were
indicators of likely success. The overwhelming temptation is to apply
them to startups too, but this doesn’t work, because startups
operate with too much uncertainty. Startups do not yet know who their
customer is or what their product should be. As the world becomes
more uncertain, it gets harder and harder to predict the future. The
old management methods are not up to the task.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Planning
and forecasting are only accurate when based on a long, stable
operating history and a relatively static environment. Startups</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	stable
operating history and a relatively static environment. Startups have
neither.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
second problem is that after seeing traditional management fail to
solve this problem, some entrepreneurs and investors have thrown up
their hands and adopted the “Just Do It” school of startups. This
school believes that if management is the problem, chaos is the
answer. Unfortunately, as I can at est rsthand, this doesn’t work
either.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
may seem counterintuitive to think that something as disruptive,
innovative, and chaotic as a startup can be managed or, to be
accurate, must be managed. Most people think of process and
management as boring and dul , whereas startups are dynamic and
exciting. But what is actual y exciting is to see startups succeed
and change the world. The passion, energy, and vision that people
bring to these new ventures are resources too precious to waste. We
can—</p>

THIS BOOK IS ORGANIZED</b></p>

book is divided into three parts: “Vision,” “Steer,” and</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Accelerate.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Vision”
makes the case for a new discipline of entrepreneurial management. I
identify who is an entrepreneur, de ne a startup, and articulate a
new way for startups to gauge if they are making progress, cal ed
validated learning. To achieve that learning, we’l see that
startups—in a garage or inside an enterprise—can use scienti c
experimentation to discover how to build a sustainable business.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Steer”
dives into the Lean Startup method in detail, showing one major turn
through the core Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Beginning
with leap-of-faith assumptions that cry out for rigorous testing,
you’l learn how to build a minimum viable product to test those
assumptions, a new accounting system for evaluating whether you’re
making progress, and a method for deciding whether to pivot (changing
course with one foot anchored to the ground) or persevere.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
“Accelerate,” we’l explore techniques that enable Lean Startups
to speed through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop as quickly as
possible, even as they scale. We’l explore lean manufacturing
concepts that are applicable to startups, too, such as the power of
smal batches. We’l also discuss organizational design, how products
grow, and how to apply Lean Startup principles beyond the proverbial
garage, even inside the world’s largest companies.</p>

MANAGEMENT</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Building
a startup is an exercise in institution building; thus, it
necessarily involves management. This often comes as a surprise to
aspiring entrepreneurs, because their associations with these two
words are so diametrical y opposed. Entrepreneurs are rightly wary of
implementing traditional management practices early on in a startup,
afraid that they wil invite bureaucracy or stifle creativity.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Entrepreneurs
have been trying to t the square peg of their unique problems into
the round hole of general management for decades. As a result, many
entrepreneurs take a “just do it” at itude, avoiding al forms of
management, process, and discipline.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
this approach leads to chaos more often than it does to success. I
should know: my rst startup failures were al of this kind.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
tremendous success of general management over the last century has
provided unprecedented material abundance, but those management
principles are il suited to handle the chaos and uncertainty that
startups must face.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
believe that entrepreneurship requires a managerial discipline to
harness the entrepreneurial opportunity we have been given.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
are more entrepreneurs operating today than at any previous time in
history. This has been made possible by dramatic</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	previous
time in history. This has been made possible by dramatic changes in
the global economy. To cite but one example, one often hears
commentators lament the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United
States over the previous two decades, but one rarely hears about a
corresponding loss of manufacturing capability. That’s because
total manufacturing output in the United States is increasing (by 15
percent in the last decade) even as jobs continue to be lost (see the
charts below). In e ect, the huge productivity increases made
possible by modern management and technology have created more
productive capacity than rms know what to do with.1</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
are living through an unprecedented worldwide entrepreneurial
renaissance, but this opportunity is laced with peril.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Because
we lack a coherent management paradigm for new innovative ventures,
we’re throwing our excess capacity around with wild abandon.
Despite this lack of rigor, we are nding some ways to make money, but
for every success there are far too many failures: products pul ed
from shelves mere weeks after being launched, high-pro le startups
lauded in the press and forgot en a few months later, and new
products that wind up being used by nobody. What makes these failures
particularly painful is not just the economic damage done to
individual employees, companies, and investors; they are also a
colossal waste of our civilization’s most precious resource: the
time, passion, and skil of its people.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	THE
ROOTS OF THE LEAN STARTUP</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Lean Startup takes its name from the lean manufacturing revolution
that Tai chi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo are credited with developing at
Toyota. Lean thinking is radical y altering the way supply chains and
production systems are run. Among its tenets are drawing on the
knowledge and creativity of individual workers, the shrinking of
batch sizes, just-in-time production and inventory control, and an
acceleration of cycle times. It taught the world the di erence
between value-creating activities and waste and showed how to build
quality into products from the inside out.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Lean Startup adapts these ideas to the context of entrepreneurship,
proposing that entrepreneurs judge their progress di erently from the
way other kinds of ventures do. Progress in</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	di
erently from the way other kinds of ventures do. Progress in
manufacturing is measured by the production of high-quality physical
goods. As we’l see in Chapter 3, the Lean Startup uses a di erent
unit of progress, cal ed validated learning. With scientific learning
as our yardstick, we can discover and eliminate the sources of waste
that are plaguing entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
comprehensive theory of entrepreneurship should address al the
functions of an early-stage venture: vision and concept, product
development, marketing and sales, scaling up, partnerships and
distribution, and structure and organizational design. It has to
provide a method for measuring progress in the context of extreme
uncertainty. It can give entrepreneurs clear guidance on how to make
the many trade-o decisions they face: whether and when to invest in
process; formulating, planning, and creating infrastructure; when to
go it alone and when to partner; when to respond to feedback and when
to stick with vision; and how and when to invest in scaling the
business. Most of al , it must al ow entrepreneurs to make testable
predictions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, consider the recommendation that you build cross-functional
teams and hold them accountable to what we cal learning milestones
instead of organizing your company into strict functional departments
(marketing, sales, information technology, human resources, etc.)
that hold people accountable for performing wel in their specialized
areas (see Chapter 7). Perhaps you agree with this recommendation, or
perhaps you are skeptical. Either way, if you decide to implement it,
I predict that you pret y quickly wil get feedback from your teams
that the new process is reducing their productivity. They wil ask to
go back to the old way of working, in which they had the opportunity
to “stay e cient” by working in larger batches and passing work
between departments.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It’s
safe to predict this result, and not just because I have seen it many
times in the companies I work with. It is a straightforward
prediction of the Lean Startup theory itself. When people are used to
evaluating their productivity local y, they feel that a good day is
one in which they did their job wel al day. When I worked as a
programmer, that meant eight straight hours of programming without
interruption. That was a good day. In contrast, if I was</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	 
<img src="205812606c9480f20c08cca756509bf8_html_d8a50c703f7fe606.jpg" name="Image7" align="bottom" width="34" height="6" border="0"/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	without
interruption. That was a good day. In contrast, if I was interrupted
with questions, process, or—heaven forbid—meetings, I felt bad.
What did I real y accomplish that day? Code and product features were
tangible to me; I could see them, understand them, and show them of .
Learning, by contrast, is frustratingly intangible.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Lean Startup asks people to start measuring their productivity di
erently. Because startups often accidental y build something nobody
wants, it doesn’t mat er much if they do it on time and on budget.
The goal of a startup is to gure out the right thing to build—the
thing customers want and wil pay for—as quickly as possible. In
other words, the Lean Startup is a new way of looking at the
development of innovative new products that emphasizes fast iteration
and customer insight, a huge vision, and great ambition, al at the
same time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Henry
Ford is one of the most successful and celebrated entrepreneurs of al
time. Since the idea of management has been bound up with the history
of the automobile since its rst days, I believe it is t ing to use
the automobile as a metaphor for a startup.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	An
internal combustion automobile is powered by two important and very
di erent feedback loops. The rst feedback loop is deep inside the
engine. Before Henry Ford was a famous CEO, he was an engineer. He
spent his days and nights tinkering in his garage with the precise
mechanics of get ing the engine cylinders to move. Each tiny
explosion within the cylinder provides the motive force to turn the
wheels but also drives the ignition of the next explosion. Unless the
timing of this feedback loop is managed precisely, the engine wil
sput er and break down.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Startups
have a similar engine that I cal the engine of growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
markets and customers for startups are diverse: a toy company, a
consulting rm, and a manufacturing plant may not seem like they have
much in common, but, as we’l see, they operate with the same engine
of growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Every
new version of a product, every new feature, and every</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Every
new version of a product, every new feature, and every new marketing
program is an at empt to improve this engine of growth. Like Henry
Ford’s tinkering in his garage, not al of these changes turn out to
be improvements. New product development happens in ts and starts.
Much of the time in a startup’s life is spent tuning the engine by
making improvements in product, marketing, or operations.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
second important feedback loop in an automobile is between the driver
and the steering wheel. This feedback is so immediate and automatic
that we often don’t think about it, but it is steering that di
erentiates driving from most other forms of transportation. If you
have a daily commute, you probably know the route so wel that your
hands seem to steer you there on their own accord. We can practical y
drive the route in our sleep. Yet if I asked you to close your eyes
and write down exactly how to get to your o ce—not the street
directions but every action you need to take, every push of hand on
wheel and foot on pedals—you’d nd it impossible. The choreography
of driving is incredibly complex when one slows down to think about
it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	By
contrast, a rocket ship requires just this kind of in-advance
calibration. It must be launched with the most precise instructions
on what to do: every thrust, every ring of a booster, and every
change in direction. The tiniest error at the point of launch could
yield catastrophic results thousands of miles later.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
too many startup business plans look more like they are planning to
launch a rocket ship than drive a car. They prescribe the steps to
take and the results to expect in excruciating detail, and as in
planning to launch a rocket, they are set up in such a way that even
tiny errors in assumptions can lead to catastrophic outcomes.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	One
company I worked with had the misfortune of forecasting signi cant
customer adoption—in the mil ions—for one of its new products.
Powered by a splashy launch, the company successful y executed its
plan. Unfortunately, customers did not ock to the product in great
numbers. Even worse, the company had invested in massive
infrastructure, hiring, and support to handle the in ux of customers
it expected. When the customers failed to materialize, the</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	customers
it expected. When the customers failed to materialize, the company
had commit ed itself so completely that they could not adapt in time.
They had “achieved failure”—successful y, faithful y, and
rigorously executing a plan that turned out to have been ut erly
flawed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Lean Startup method, in contrast, is designed to teach you how to
drive a startup. Instead of making complex plans that are based on a
lot of assumptions, you can make constant adjustments with a steering
wheel cal ed the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Through this
process of steering, we can learn when and if it’s time to make a
sharp turn cal ed a pivot or whether we should persevere along our
current path. Once we have an engine that’s revved up, the Lean
Startup o ers methods to scale and grow the business with maximum
acceleration.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Throughout
the process of driving, you always have a clear idea of where you’re
going. If you’re commuting to work, you don’t give up because
there’s a detour in the road or you made a wrong turn.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	You
remain thoroughly focused on get ing to your destination.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Startups
also have a true north, a destination in mind: creating a thriving
and world-changing business. I cal that a startup’s vision.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
achieve that vision, startups employ a strategy, which includes a
business model, a product road map, a point of view about partners
and competitors, and ideas about who the customer wil be. The product
is the end result of this strategy (see the chart on this page).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Products
change constantly through the process of optimization, what I cal
tuning the engine. Less frequently, the strategy may have to change
(cal ed a pivot). However, the overarching vision rarely changes.
Entrepreneurs are commit ed to seeing the startup through to that
destination. Every setback is an opportunity for learning how to get
where they want to go (see the chart below).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
real life, a startup is a portfolio of activities. A lot is happening
simultaneously: the engine is running, acquiring new customers and
serving existing ones; we are tuning, trying to improve our product,
marketing, and operations; and we are steering, deciding if and when
to pivot. The chal enge of entrepreneurship is to balance al these
activities. Even the smal est startup faces the chal enge of
supporting existing customers while trying to innovate. Even the most
established company faces the imperative to invest in innovation lest
it become obsolete. As companies grow, what changes is the mix of
these activities in the company’s portfolio of work.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Entrepreneurship
is management. And yet, imagine a modern manager who is tasked with
building a new product in the context of an established company.
Imagine that she goes back to her company’s chief nancial o cer
(CFO) a year later and says, “We have failed to meet the growth
targets we predicted. In fact, we have almost no new customers and no
new revenue. However, we have learned an incredible amount and are on
the cusp of a breakthrough new line of business. Al we need is
another year.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
of the time, this would be the last report this intrapreneur would
give her employer. The reason is that in general management, a
failure to deliver results is due to either a failure to plan
adequately or a failure to execute properly. Both are signi cant
lapses, yet new product development in our modern economy routinely
requires exactly this kind of failure on the way to greatness. In the
Lean Startup movement, we have come to realize that these internal
innovators are actual y entrepreneurs, too, and that entrepreneurial
management can help them succeed; this is the subject of the next
chapter.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2DEFINE</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	WHO,
EXACTLY, IS AN ENTREPRENEUR?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
I travel the world talking about the Lean Startup, I’m consistently
surprised that I meet people in the audience who seem out of place.
In addition to the more traditional startup entrepreneurs I meet,
these people are general managers, mostly working in very large
companies, who are tasked with creating new ventures or product
innovations. They are adept at organizational politics: they know how
to form autonomous divisions with separate pro t and loss statements
(P&amp;Ls) and can shield controversial teams from corporate
meddling. The biggest surprise is that they are visionaries. Like the
startup founders I have worked with for years, they can see the
future of their industries and are prepared to take bold risks to
seek out new and innovative solutions to the problems their companies
face.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Mark,
for example, is a manager for an extremely large company who came to
one of my lectures. He is the leader of a division that recently had
been chartered to bring his company into the twenty-rst century by
building a new suite of products designed to take advantage of the
Internet. When he came to talk to me afterward, I started to give him
the standard advice about how to create innovation teams inside big
companies, and he stopped me in midstream: “Yeah, I’ve read The
Innovator’s Dilemma.1 I’ve got that al taken care of.” He was a
long-term employee of the company and a successful manager to boot,
so managing internal politics was</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	and
a successful manager to boot, so managing internal politics was the
least of his problems. I should have known; his success was a
testament to his ability to navigate the company’s corporate
policies, personnel, and processes to get things done.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Next,
I tried to give him some advice about the future, about cool new
highly leveraged product development technologies. He interrupted me
again: “Right. I know al about the Internet, and I have a vision
for how our company needs to adapt to it or die.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Mark
has al the entrepreneurial prerequisites nailed—proper team
structure, good personnel, a strong vision for the future, and an
appetite for risk taking—and so it nal y occurred to me to ask why
he was coming to me for advice. He said, “It’s as if we have al
of the raw materials: kindling, wood, paper, int, even some sparks.
But where’s the re?” The theories of management that Mark had
studied treat innovation like a “black box” by focusing on the
structures companies need to put in place to form internal startup
teams. But Mark found himself working inside the black box—and in
need of guidance.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
Mark was missing was a process for converting the raw materials of
innovation into real-world breakthrough successes.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Once
a team is set up, what should it do? What process should it use? How
should it be held accountable to performance milestones? These are
questions the Lean Startup methodology is designed to answer.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	My
point? Mark is an entrepreneur just like a Silicon Val ey high-tech
founder with a garage startup. He needs the principles of the Lean
Startup just as much as the folks I thought of as classic
entrepreneurs do.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Entrepreneurs
who operate inside an established organization sometimes are cal ed
“intrapreneurs” because of the special circumstances that at end
building a startup within a larger company. As I have applied Lean
Startup ideas in an ever-widening variety of companies and
industries, I have come to believe that intrapreneurs have much more
in common with the rest of the community of entrepreneurs than most
people believe. Thus, when I use the term entrepreneur, I am
referring to the whole startup ecosystem regardless of company size,
sector, or stage of</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	ecosystem
regardless of company size, sector, or stage of development.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
book is for entrepreneurs of al stripes: from young visionaries with
lit le backing but great ideas to seasoned visionaries within larger
companies such as Mark—and the people who hold them accountable.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	IF
I’M AN ENTREPRENEUR, WHAT’S A STARTUP?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Lean Startup is a set of practices for helping entrepreneurs increase
their odds of building a successful startup. To set the record
straight, it’s important to define what a startup is: A startup is
a human institution designed to create a new product or service under
conditions of extreme uncertainty.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I’ve
come to realize that the most important part of this de nition is
what it omits. It says nothing about size of the company, the
industry, or the sector of the economy. Anyone who is creating a new
product or business under conditions of extreme uncertainty is an
entrepreneur whether he or she knows it or not and whether working in
a government agency, a venture-backed company, a nonpro t, or a
decidedly for-pro t company with financial investors.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Let’s
take a look at each of the pieces. The word institution connotes
bureaucracy, process, even lethargy. How can that be part of a
startup? Yet successful startups are ful of activities associated
with building an institution: hiring creative employees, coordinating
their activities, and creating a company culture that delivers
results.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
often lose sight of the fact that a startup is not just about a
product, a technological breakthrough, or even a bril iant idea. A
startup is greater than the sum of its parts; it is an acutely human
enterprise.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
fact that a startup’s product or service is a new innovation is
also an essential part of the de nition and a tricky part too. I
prefer to use the broadest de nition of product, one that encompasses
any</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	to
use the broadest de nition of product, one that encompasses any
source of value for the people who become customers. Anything those
customers experience from their interaction with a company should be
considered part of that company’s product. This is true of a
grocery store, an e-commerce website, a consulting service, and a
nonpro t social service agency. In every case, the organization is
dedicated to uncovering a new source of value for customers and cares
about the impact of its product on those customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It’s
also important that the word innovation be understood broadly.
Startups use many kinds of innovation: novel scienti c discoveries,
repurposing an existing technology for a new use, devising a new
business model that unlocks value that was hidden, or simply bringing
a product or service to a new location or a previously underserved
set of customers. In al these cases, innovation is at the heart of
the company’s success.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
is one more important part of this definition: the context in which
the innovation happens. Most businesses—large and smal alike—are
excluded from this context. Startups are designed to confront
situations of extreme uncertainty. To open up a new business that is
an exact clone of an existing business al the way down to the
business model, pricing, target customer, and product may be an at
ractive economic investment, but it is not a startup because its
success depends only on execution—so much so that this success can
be modeled with high accuracy. (This is why so many smal businesses
can be nanced with simple bank loans; the level of risk and
uncertainty is understood wel enough that a loan o cer can assess its
prospects.)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
tools from general management are not designed to ourish in the harsh
soil of extreme uncertainty in which startups thrive.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
future is unpredictable, customers face a growing array of
alternatives, and the pace of change is ever increasing. Yet most
startups—in garages and enterprises alike—stil are managed by
using standard forecasts, product milestones, and detailed business
plans.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>THE
SNAPTAX STORY</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
2009, a startup decided to try something real y audacious. They
wanted to liberate taxpayers from expensive tax stores by automating
the process of col ecting information typical y found on W-2 forms
(the end-of-year statement that most employees receive from their
employer that summarizes their taxable wages for the year). The
startup quickly ran into di culties. Even though many consumers had
access to a printer/scanner in their home or o ce, few knew how to
use those devices. After numerous conversations with potential
customers, the team lit upon the idea of having customers take
photographs of the forms directly from their cel phone. In the
process of testing this concept, customers asked something
unexpected: would it be possible to nish the whole tax return right
on the phone itself?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	That
was not an easy task. Traditional tax preparation requires consumers
to wade through hundreds of questions, many forms, and a lot of
paperwork. This startup tried something novel by deciding to ship an
early version of its product that could do much less than a complete
tax package. The initial version worked only for consumers with a
very simple return to le, and it worked only in California.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead
of having consumers l out a complex form, they al owed the customers
to use the phone’s camera to take a picture of their W-2 forms.
From that single picture, the company developed the technology to
compile and le most of the 1040 EZ</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	tax
return. Compared with the drudgery of traditional tax ling, the new
product—cal ed SnapTax—provides a magical experience.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	From
its modest beginning, SnapTax grew into a signi cant startup success
story. Its nationwide launch in 2011 showed that customers loved it,
to the tune of more than 350,000 downloads in the rst three weeks.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is the kind of amazing innovation you’d expect from a new startup.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
the name of this company may surprise you. SnapTax was developed by
Intuit, America’s largest producer of nance, tax, and accounting
tools for individuals and smal businesses. With</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	and
accounting tools for individuals and smal businesses. With more than
7,700 employees and annual revenues in the bil ions, Intuit is not a
typical startup.2</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
team that built SnapTax doesn’t look much like the archetypal image
of entrepreneurs either. They don’t work in a garage or eat ramen
noodles. Their company doesn’t lack for resources. They are paid a
ful salary and benefits. They come into a regular of ice every day.
Yet they are entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Stories
like this one are not nearly as common inside large corporations as
they should be. After al , SnapTax competes directly with one of
Intuit’s agship products: the ful y featured TurboTax desktop
software. Usual y, companies like Intuit fal into the trap described
in Clayton Christensten’s The Innovator’s Dilemma: they are very
good at creating incremental improvements to existing products and
serving existing customers, which Christensen cal ed sustaining
innovation, but struggle to create breakthrough new
products—disruptive innovation—that can create new sustainable
sources of growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	One
remarkable part of the SnapTax story is what the team leaders said
when I asked them to account for their unlikely success.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Did
they hire superstar entrepreneurs from outside the company?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	No,
they assembled a team from within Intuit. Did they face constant
meddling from senior management, which is the bane of innovation
teams in many companies? No, their executive sponsors created an
“island of freedom” where they could experiment as necessary. Did
they have a huge team, a large budget, and lots of marketing dol ars?
Nope, they started with a team of five.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
al owed the SnapTax team to innovate was not their genes, destiny, or
astrological signs but a process deliberately facilitated by Intuit’s
senior management. Innovation is a bot oms-up, decentralized, and
unpredictable thing, but that doesn’t mean it cannot be managed. It
can, but to do so requires a new management discipline, one that
needs to be mastered not just by practicing entrepreneurs seeking to
build the next big thing but also by the people who support them,
nurture them, and hold them accountable. In other words, cultivating
entrepreneurship is the</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	accountable.
In other words, cultivating entrepreneurship is the responsibility of
senior management. Today, a cut ing-edge company such as Intuit can
point to success stories like SnapTax because it has recognized the
need for a new management paradigm. This is a realization that was
years in the making.3</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
SEVEN-THOUSAND-PERSON LEAN STARTUP</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
1983, Intuit’s founder, the legendary entrepreneur Scot Cook, had
the radical notion (with cofounder Tom Proulx) that personal
accounting should happen by computer. Their success was far from
inevitable; they faced numerous competitors, an uncertain future, and
an initial y tiny market. A decade later, the company went public and
subsequently fended o wel -publicized at acks from larger incumbents,
including the software behemoth Microsoft.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Partly
with the help of famed venture capitalist John Doerr, Intuit became a
ful y diversi ed enterprise, a member of the Fortune 1000 that now
provides dozens of market-leading products across its major
divisions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is the kind of entrepreneurial success we’re used to hearing about:
a ragtag team of underdogs who eventual y achieve fame, acclaim, and
significant riches.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Flash-forward
to 2002. Cook was frustrated. He had just tabulated ten years of data
on al of Intuit’s new product introductions and had concluded that
the company was get ing a measly return on its massive investments.
Simply put, too many of its new products were failing. By traditional
standards, Intuit is an extremely wel -</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	managed
company, but as Scot dug into the root causes of those failures, he
came to a di cult conclusion: the prevailing management paradigm he
and his company had been practicing was inadequate to the problem of
continuous innovation in the modern economy.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	By
fal 2009, Cook had been working to change Intuit’s management
culture for several years. He came across my early work on the Lean
Startup and asked me to give a talk at Intuit. In Silicon Val ey this
is not the kind of invitation you turn down. I</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Silicon
Val ey this is not the kind of invitation you turn down. I admit I
was curious. I was stil at the beginning of my Lean Startup journey
and didn’t have much appreciation for the chal enges faced by a
Fortune 1000 company like his.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	My
conversations with Cook and Intuit chief executive o cer (CEO) Brad
Smith were my initiation into the thinking of modern general
managers, who struggle with entrepreneurship every bit as much as do
venture capitalists and founders in a garage. To combat these chal
enges, Scot and Brad are going back to Intuit’s roots.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
are working to build entrepreneurship and risk taking into al their
divisions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, consider one of Intuit’s agship products. Because TurboTax
does most of its sales around tax season in the United States, it
used to have an extremely conservative culture. Over the course of
the year, the marketing and product teams would conceive one major
initiative that would be rol ed out just in time for tax season. Now
they test over ve hundred di erent changes in a two-and-a-half-month
tax season. They’re running up to seventy di erent tests per week.
The team can make a change live on its website on Thursday, run it
over the weekend, read the results on Monday, and come to conclusions
starting Tuesday; then they rebuild new tests on Thursday and launch
the next set on Thursday night.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
Scot put it, “Boy, the amount of learning they get is just immense
now. And what it does is develop entrepreneurs, because when you have
only one test, you don’t have entrepreneurs, you have politicians,
because you have to sel . Out of a hundred good ideas, you’ve got
to sel your idea. So you build up a society of politicians and
salespeople. When you have ve hundred tests you’re running, then
everybody’s ideas can run. And then you create entrepreneurs who
run and learn and can retest and relearn as opposed to a society of
politicians. So we’re trying to drive that throughout our
organization, using examples which have nothing to do with high tech,
like the website example. Every business today has a website. You
don’t have to be high tech to use fast-cycle testing.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
kind of change is hard. After al , the company has a</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
kind of change is hard. After al , the company has a signi cant
number of existing customers who continue to demand exceptional
service and investors who expect steady, growing returns.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Scot
says,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
goes against the grain of what people have been taught in business
and what leaders have been taught. The problem isn’t with the teams
or the entrepreneurs. They love the chance to quickly get their baby
out into the market. They love the chance to have the customer vote
instead of the suits voting. The real issue is with the leaders and
the middle managers. There are many business leaders who have been
successful because of analysis. They think they’re analysts, and
their job is to do great planning and analyzing and have a plan.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
amount of time a company can count on holding on to market leadership
to exploit its earlier innovations is shrinking, and this creates an
imperative for even the most entrenched companies to invest in
innovation. In fact, I believe a company’s only sustainable path to
long-term economic growth is to build an</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“innovation
factory” that uses Lean Startup techniques to create disruptive
innovations on a continuous basis. In other words, established
companies need to gure out how to accomplish what Scot Cook did in
1983, but on an industrial scale and with an established cohort of
managers steeped in traditional management culture.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Ever
the maverick, Cook asked me to put these ideas to the test, and so I
gave a talk that was simulcast to al seven thousand–plus Intuit
employees during which I explained the theory of the Lean Startup,
repeating my de nition: an organization designed to create new
products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
happened next is etched in my memory. CEO Brad Smith had been sit ing
next to me as I spoke. When I was done, he got up and said before al
of Intuit’s employees, “Folks, listen up. You</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	and
said before al of Intuit’s employees, “Folks, listen up. You
heard Eric’s definition of a startup. It has three parts, and we
here at Intuit match al three parts of that definition.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Scot
and Brad are leaders who realize that something new is needed in
management thinking. Intuit is proof that this kind of thinking can
work in established companies. Brad explained to me how they hold
themselves accountable for their new innovation e orts by measuring
two things: the number of customers using products that didn’t
exist three years ago and the percentage of revenue coming from of
erings that did not exist three years ago.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Under
the old model, it took an average of 5.5 years for a successful new
product to start generating $50 mil ion in revenue.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Brad
explained to me, “We’ve generated $50 mil ion in o erings that
did not exist twelve months ago in the last year. Now it’s not one
particular o ering. It’s a combination of a whole bunch of
innovation happening, but that’s the kind of stu that’s creating
some energy for us, that we think we can truly short-circuit the ramp
by kil ing things that don’t make sense fast and doubling down on
the ones that do.” For a company as large as Intuit, these are
modest results and early days. They have decades of legacy systems
and legacy thinking to overcome. However, their leadership in
adopting entrepreneurial management is starting to pay of .</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Leadership
requires creating conditions that enable employees to do the kinds of
experimentation that entrepreneurship requires. For example, changes
in TurboTax enabled the Intuit team to develop ve hundred experiments
per tax season. Before that, marketers with great ideas couldn’t
have done those tests even if they’d wanted to, because they didn’t
have a system in place through which to change the website rapidly.
Intuit invested in systems that increased the speed at which tests
could be built, deployed, and analyzed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
Cook says, “Developing these experimentation systems is the
responsibility of senior management; they have to be put in by the
leadership. It’s moving leaders from playing Caesar with their
thumbs up and down on every idea to—instead—put ing in the
culture and the systems so that teams can move and innovate at the
speed of the experimentation system.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3LEARN</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
an entrepreneur, nothing plagued me more than the question of whether
my company was making progress toward creating a successful business.
As an engineer and later as a manager, I was accustomed to measuring
progress by making sure our work proceeded according to plan, was
high quality, and cost about what we had projected.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	After
many years as an entrepreneur, I started to worry about measuring
progress in this way. What if we found ourselves building something
that nobody wanted? In that case what did it mat er if we did it on
time and on budget? When I went home at the end of a day’s work,
the only things I knew for sure were that I had kept people busy and
spent money that day. I hoped that my team’s e orts took us closer
to our goal. If we wound up taking a wrong turn, I’d have to take
comfort in the fact that at least we’d learned something important.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
“learning” is the oldest excuse in the book for a failure of
execution. It’s what managers fal back on when they fail to achieve
the results we promised. Entrepreneurs, under pressure to succeed,
are wildly creative when it comes to demonstrating what we have
learned. We can al tel a good story when our job, career, or
reputation depends on it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
learning is cold comfort to employees who are fol owing an
entrepreneur into the unknown. It is cold comfort to the investors
who al ocate precious money, time, and energy to entrepreneurial
teams. It is cold comfort to the organizations—large</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	entrepreneurial
teams. It is cold comfort to the organizations—large and smal —that
depend on entrepreneurial innovation to survive.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	You
can’t take learning to the bank; you can’t spend it or invest it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	You
cannot give it to customers and cannot return it to limited partners.
Is it any wonder that learning has a bad name in entrepreneurial and
managerial circles?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Yet
if the fundamental goal of entrepreneurship is to engage in
organization building under conditions of extreme uncertainty, its
most vital function is learning. We must learn the truth about which
elements of our strategy are working to realize our vision and which
are just crazy. We must learn what customers real y want, not what
they say they want or what we think they should want. We must
discover whether we are on a path that wil lead to growing a
sustainable business.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
the Lean Startup model, we are rehabilitating learning with a concept
I cal validated learning. Validated learning is not after-the-fact
rationalization or a good story designed to hide failure. It is a
rigorous method for demonstrating progress when one is embedded in
the soil of extreme uncertainty in which startups grow. Validated
learning is the process of demonstrating empirical y that a team has
discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future
business prospects. It is more concrete, more accurate, and faster
than market forecasting or classical business planning. It is the
principal antidote to the lethal problem of achieving failure:
successful y executing a plan that leads nowhere.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>VALIDATED
LEARNING AT IMVU</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Let
me il ustrate this with an example from my career. Many audiences
have heard me recount the story of IMVU’s founding and the many
mistakes we made in developing our rst product. I’l now elaborate
on one of those mistakes to il ustrate validated learning clearly.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Those
of us involved in the founding of IMVU aspired to be serious
strategic thinkers. Each of us had participated in previous ventures
that had failed, and we were loath to repeat that</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	ventures
that had failed, and we were loath to repeat that experience. Our
main concerns in the early days dealt with the fol owing questions:
What should we build and for whom? What market could we enter and
dominate? How could we build durable value that would not be subject
to erosion by competition?1</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Bril
iant Strategy</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
decided to enter the instant messaging (IM) market. In 2004, that
market had hundreds of mil ions of consumers actively participating
worldwide. However, the majority of the customers who were using IM
products were not paying for the privilege.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead,
large media and portal companies such as AOL, Microsoft, and Yahoo!
operated their IM networks as a loss leader for other services while
making modest amounts of money through advertising.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	IM
is an example of a market that involves strong network ef ects. Like
most communication networks, IM is thought to fol ow Metcalfe’s
law: the value of a network as a whole is proportional to the square
of the number of participants. In other words, the more people in the
network, the more valuable the network. This makes intuitive sense:
the value to each participant is driven primarily by how many other
people he or she can communicate with. Imagine a world in which you
own the only telephone; it would have no value. Only when other
people also have a telephone does it become valuable.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
2004, the IM market was locked up by a handful of incumbents. The top
three networks control ed more than 80</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	percent
of the overal usage and were in the process of consolidating their
gains in market share at the expense of a number of smal er players.2
The common wisdom was that it was more or less impossible to bring a
new IM network to market without spending an extraordinary amount of
money on marketing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
reason for that wisdom is simple. Because of the power of network e
ects, IM products have high switching costs. To switch from one
network to another, customers would have to convince</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	from
one network to another, customers would have to convince their
friends and col eagues to switch with them. This extra work for
customers creates a barrier to entry in the IM market: with al
consumers locked in to an incumbent’s product, there are no
customers left with whom to establish a beachhead.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	At
IMVU we set led on a strategy of building a product that would
combine the large mass appeal of traditional IM with the high revenue
per customer of three-dimensional (3D) video games and virtual
worlds. Because of the near impossibility of bringing a new IM
network to market, we decided to build an IM add-on product that
would interoperate with the existing networks. Thus, customers would
be able to adopt the IMVU virtual goods and avatar communication
technology without having to switch IM</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	providers,
learn a new user interface, and—most important—bring their
friends with them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
fact, we thought this last point was essential. For the add-on
product to be useful, customers would have to use it with their
existing friends. Every communication would come embedded with an
invitation to join IMVU. Our product would be inherently viral,
spreading throughout the existing IM networks like an epidemic. To
achieve that viral growth, it was important that our add-on product
support as many of the existing IM networks as possible and work on
al kinds of computers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Six
Months to Launch</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	With
this strategy in place, my cofounders and I began a period of intense
work. As the chief technology o cer, it was my responsibility, among
other things, to write the software that would support IM
interoperability across networks. My cofounders and I worked for
months, put ing in crazy hours struggling to get our rst product
released. We gave ourselves a hard deadline of six months</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	—180
days—to launch the product and at ract our rst paying customers. It
was a grueling schedule, but we were determined to launch on time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
add-on product was so large and complex and had so many</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
add-on product was so large and complex and had so many moving parts
that we had to cut a lot of corners to get it done on time. I won’t
mince words: the rst version was terrible. We spent endless hours
arguing about which bugs to x and which we could live with, which
features to cut and which to try to cram in. It was a wonderful and
terrifying time: we were ful of hope about the possibilities for
success and ful of fear about the consequences of shipping a bad
product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Personal
y, I was worried that the low quality of the product would tarnish my
reputation as an engineer. People would think I didn’t know how to
build a quality product. Al of us feared tarnishing the IMVU brand;
after al , we were charging people money for a product that didn’t
work very wel . We al envisioned the damning newspaper headlines:
“Inept Entrepreneurs Build Dreadful Product.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
launch day approached, our fears escalated. In our situation, many
entrepreneurial teams give in to fear and postpone the launch date.
Although I understand this impulse, I am glad we persevered, since
delay prevents many startups from get ing the feedback they need. Our
previous failures made us more afraid of another, even worse, outcome
than shipping a bad product: building something that nobody wants.
And so, teeth clenched and apologies at the ready, we released our
product to the public.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Launch</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	And
then—nothing happened! It turned out that our fears were unfounded,
because nobody even tried our product. At rst I was relieved because
at least nobody was nding out how bad the product was, but soon that
gave way to serious frustration. After al the hours we had spent
arguing about which features to include and which bugs to x, our
value proposition was so far o that customers weren’t get ing far
enough into the experience to nd out how bad our design choices were.
Customers wouldn’t even download our product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Over

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Over
the ensuing weeks and months, we labored to make the product bet er.
We brought in a steady ow of customers through our online
registration and download process. We treated each day’s customers
as a brand-new report card to let us know how we were doing. We
eventual y learned how to change the product’s positioning so that
customers at least would download it. We were making improvements to
the underlying product continuously, shipping bug xes and new changes
daily. However, despite our best e orts, we were able to persuade
only a pathetical y smal number of people to buy the product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
retrospect, one good decision we made was to set clear revenue
targets for those early days. In the rst month we intended to make
$300 in total revenue, and we did—barely. Many friends and family
members were asked (okay, begged). Each month our smal revenue
targets increased, rst to $350 and then to $400. As they rose, our
struggles increased. We soon ran out of friends and family; our
frustration escalated. We were making the product bet er every day,
yet our customers’ behavior remained unchanged: they stil wouldn’t
use it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Our
failure to move the numbers prodded us to accelerate our e orts to
bring customers into our o ce for in-person interviews and usability
tests. The quantitative targets created the motivation to engage in
qualitative inquiry and guided us in the questions we asked; this is
a pat ern we’l see throughout this book.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
wish I could say that I was the one to realize our mistake and
suggest the solution, but in truth, I was the last to admit the
problem. In short, our entire strategic analysis of the market was ut
erly wrong. We gured this out empirical y, through experimentation,
rather than through focus groups or market research. Customers could
not tel us what they wanted; most, after al , had never heard of 3D
avatars. Instead, they revealed the truth through their action or
inaction as we struggled to make the product bet er.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Talking
to Customers</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Out
of desperation, we decided to talk to some potential customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
brought them into our o ce, and said, “Try this new product; it’s
IMVU.” If the person was a teenager, a heavy user of IM, or a tech
early adopter, he or she would engage with us. In constrast, if it
was a mainstream person, the response was, “Right. So exactly what
would you like me to do?” We’d get nowhere with the mainstream
group; they thought IMVU was too weird.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Imagine
a seventeen-year-old girl sit ing down with us to look at this
product. She chooses her avatar and says, “Oh, this is real y fun.”
She’s customizing the avatar, deciding how she’s going to look.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Then
we say, “Al right, it’s time to download the instant messaging
add-on,” and she responds, “What’s that?”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Wel
, it’s this thing that interoperates with the instant messaging
client.” She’s looking at us and thinking, “I’ve never heard
of that, my friends have never heard of that, why do you want me to
do that?” It required a lot of explanation; an instant messaging
add-on was not a product category that existed in her mind.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	But
since she was in the room with us, we were able to talk her into
doing it. She downloads the product, and then we say, “Okay, invite
one of your friends to chat.” And she says, “No way!” We say,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Why
not?” And she says, “Wel , I don’t know if this thing is cool
yet. You want me to risk inviting one of my friends? What are they
going to think of me? If it sucks, they’re going to think I suck,
right?” And we say, “No, no, it’s going to be so much fun once
you get the person in there; it’s a social product.” She looks at
us, her face l ed with doubt; you can see that this is a deal
breaker. Of course, the rst time I had that experience, I said, “It’s
al right, it’s just this one person, send her away and get me a new
one.” Then the second customer comes in and says the same thing.
Then the third customer comes in, and it’s the same thing. You
start to see pat erns, and no mat er how stubborn you are, there’s
obviously something wrong.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Customers
kept saying, “I want to use it by myself. I want to try it out rst
to see if it’s real y cool before I invite a friend.” Our team
was from the video game industry, so we understood what that meant:
single-player mode. So we built a single-player version.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	meant:
single-player mode. So we built a single-player version.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We’d
bring new customers into our o ce. They’d customize the avatar and
download the product like before. Then they would go into
single-player mode, and we’d say, “Play with your avatar and
dress it up; check out the cool moves it can make.” Fol owed by,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Okay,
you did that by yourself; now it’s time to invite one of your
friends.” You can see what’s coming. They’d say, “No way!
This isn’t cool.” And we’d say, “Wel , we told you it wasn’t
going to be cool!</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
is the point of a single-player experience for a social product?”
See, we thought we should get a gold star just for listening to our
customers. Except our customers stil didn’t like the product. They
would look at us and say, “Listen, old man, you don’t understand.
What is the deal with this crazy business of inviting friends before
I know if it’s cool?” It was a total deal breaker.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Out
of further desperation, we introduced a feature cal ed ChatNow that
al ows you to push a but on and be randomly matched with somebody
else anywhere in the world. The only thing you have in common is that
you both pushed the but on at the same time. Al of a sudden, in our
customer service tests, people were saying, “Oh, this is fun!”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	So
we’d bring them in, they’d use ChatNow, and maybe they would meet
somebody they thought was cool. They’d say, “Hey, that guy was
neat; I want to add him to my buddy list. Where’s my buddy list?”
And we’d say, “Oh, no, you don’t want a new buddy list; you
want to use your regular AOL buddy list.” Remember, this was how we
planned to harness the interoperability that would lead to network e
ects and viral growth. Picture the customer looking at us, asking,
“What do you want me to do exactly?” And we’d say, “Wel ,
just give the stranger your AIM screen name so you can put him on
your buddy list.” You could see their eyes go wide, and they’d
say, “Are you kidding me? A stranger on my AIM buddy list?” To
which we’d respond, “Yes; otherwise you’d have to download a
whole new IM client with a new buddy list.” And they’d say, “Do
you have any idea how many IM clients I already run?”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“No.
One or two, maybe?” That’s how many clients each of us in the o
ce used. To which the teenager would say, “Duh! I run</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	the
o ce used. To which the teenager would say, “Duh! I run eight.”
We had no idea how many instant messaging clients there were in the
world.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
had the incorrect preconception that it’s a chal enge to learn new
software and it’s tricky to move your friends over to a new buddy
list. Our customers revealed that this was nonsense. We wanted to
draw diagrams on the whiteboard that showed why our strategy was bril
iant, but our customers didn’t understand concepts like network e
ects and switching costs. If we tried to explain why they should
behave the way we predicted, they’d just shake their heads at us,
bewildered.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
had a mental model for how people used software that was years out of
date, and so eventual y, painful y, after dozens of meetings like
that, it started to dawn on us that the IM add-on concept was
fundamental y flawed.3</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Our
customers did not want an IM add-on; they wanted a stand-alone IM
network. They did not consider having to learn how to use a new IM
program a barrier; on the contrary, our early adopters used many di
erent IM programs simultaneously. Our customers were not intimidated
by the idea of having to take their friends with them to a new IM
network; it turned out that they enjoyed that chal enge. Even more
surprising, our assumption that customers would want to use
avatar-based IM primarily with their existing friends was also wrong.
They wanted to make new friends, an activity that 3D avatars are
particularly wel suited to facilitating.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Bit
by bit, customers tore apart our seemingly bril iant initial
strategy.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Throwing
My Work Away</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Perhaps
you can sympathize with our situation and forgive my obstinacy. After
al , it was my work over the prior months that needed to be thrown
away. I had slaved over the software that was required to make our IM
program interoperate with other networks, which was at the heart of
our original strategy. When it came time to pivot and abandon that
original strategy, almost al of</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	came
time to pivot and abandon that original strategy, almost al of my
work—thousands of lines of code—was thrown out. I felt betrayed.
I was a devotee of the latest in software development methods (known
col ectively as agile development), which promised to help drive
waste out of product development.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
despite that, I had commit ed the biggest waste of al : building a
product that our customers refused to use. That was real y
depressing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
wondered: in light of the fact that my work turned out to be a waste
of time and energy, would the company have been just as wel o if I
had spent the last six months on a beach sipping umbrel a drinks? Had
I real y been needed? Would it have been bet er if I had not done any
work at al ?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
is, as I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, always one last
refuge for people aching to justify their own failure. I consoled
myself that if we hadn’t built this rst product—mistakes and al
—we never would have learned these important insights about
customers. We never would have learned that our strategy was awed.
There is truth in this excuse: what we learned during those critical
early months set IMVU on a path that would lead to our eventual
breakout success.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
a time, this “learning” consolation made me feel bet er, but my
relief was short-lived. Here’s the question that bothered me most
of al : if the goal of those months was to learn these important
insights about customers, why did it take so long? How much of our e
ort contributed to the essential lessons we needed to learn?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Could
we have learned those lessons earlier if I hadn’t been so focused
on making the product “bet er” by adding features and fixing
bugs?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	VALUE
VS. WASTE</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
other words, which of our e orts are value-creating and which are
wasteful? This question is at the heart of the lean manufacturing
revolution; it is the rst question any lean manufacturing adherent is
trained to ask. Learning to see waste and then systematical y</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	is
trained to ask. Learning to see waste and then systematical y
eliminate it has al owed lean companies such as Toyota to dominate
entire industries. In the world of software, the agile development
methodologies I had practiced until that time had their origins in
lean thinking. They were designed to eliminate waste too.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Yet
those methods had led me down a road in which the majority of my
team’s ef orts were wasted. Why?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
answer came to me slowly over the subsequent years. Lean thinking de
nes value as providing bene t to the customer; anything else is
waste. In a manufacturing business, customers don’t care how the
product is assembled, only that it works correctly. But in a startup,
who the customer is and what the customer might nd valuable are
unknown, part of the very uncertainty that is an essential part of
the de nition of a startup. I realized that as a startup, we needed a
new de nition of value. The real progress we had made at IMVU was
what we had learned over those rst months about what creates value
for customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Anything
we had done during those months that did not contribute to our
learning was a form of waste. Would it have been possible to learn
the same things with less e ort? Clearly, the answer is yes.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
one thing, think of al the debate and prioritization of e ort that
went into features that customers would never discover. If we had
shipped sooner, we could have avoided that waste. Also consider al
the waste caused by our incorrect strategic assumptions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
had built interoperability for more than a dozen di erent IM</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	clients
and networks. Was this real y necessary to test our assumptions?
Could we have got en the same feedback from our customers with half
as many networks? With only three? With only one? Since the customers
of al IM networks found our product equal y unat ractive, the level
of learning would have been the same, but our ef ort would have been
dramatical y less.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Here’s
the thought that kept me up nights: did we have to support any
networks at al ? Is it possible that we could have discovered how
awed our assumptions were without building anything? For example,
what if we simply had o ered customers</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	anything?
For example, what if we simply had o ered customers the opportunity
to download the product from us solely on the basis of its proposed
features before building anything? Remember, almost no customers were
wil ing to use our original product, so we wouldn’t have had to do
much apologizing when we failed to deliver. (Note that this is di
erent from asking customers what they want. Most of the time
customers don’t know what they want in advance.) We could have
conducted an experiment, o ering customers the chance to try
something and then measuring their behavior.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Such
thought experiments were extremely disturbing to me because they
undermined my job description. As the head of product development, I
thought my job was to ensure the timely delivery of high-quality
products and features. But if many of those features were a waste of
time, what should I be doing instead? How could we avoid this waste?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I’ve
come to believe that learning is the essential unit of progress for
startups. The e ort that is not absolutely necessary for learning
what customers want can be eliminated. I cal this validated learning
because it is always demonstrated by positive improvements in the
startup’s core metrics. As we’ve seen, it’s easy to kid
yourself about what you think customers want. It’s also easy to
learn things that are completely irrelevant. Thus, validated learning
is backed up by empirical data col ected from real customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	WHERE
DO YOU FIND VALIDATION?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
I can at est, anybody who fails in a startup can claim that he or she
has learned a lot from the experience. They can tel a compel ing
story. In fact, in the story of IMVU so far, you might have noticed
something missing. Despite my claims that we learned a lot in those
early months, lessons that led to our eventual success, I haven’t o
ered any evidence to back that up. In hindsight, it’s easy to make
such claims and sound credible (and you’l see some evidence later
in the book), but imagine us in IMVU’s early months</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	evidence
later in the book), but imagine us in IMVU’s early months trying to
convince investors, employees, family members, and most of al
ourselves that we had not squandered our time and resources.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
evidence did we have?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Certainly
our stories of failure were entertaining, and we had fascinating
theories about what we had done wrong and what we needed to do to
create a more successful product. However, the proof did not come
until we put those theories into practice and built subsequent
versions of the product that showed superior results with actual
customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
next few months are where the true story of IMVU begins, not with our
bril iant assumptions and strategies and whiteboard gamesmanship but
with the hard work of discovering what customers real y wanted and
adjusting our product and strategy to meet those desires. We adopted
the view that our job was to nd a synthesis between our vision and
what customers would accept; it wasn’t to capitulate to what
customers thought they wanted or to tel customers what they ought to
want.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
we came to understand our customers bet er, we were able to improve
our products. As we did that, the fundamental metrics of our business
changed. In the early days, despite our e orts to improve the
product, our metrics were stubbornly at. We treated each day’s
customers as a new report card. We’d pay at ention to the
percentage of new customers who exhibited product behaviors such as
downloading and buying our product. Each day, roughly the same number
of customers would buy the product, and that number was pret y close
to zero despite the many improvements.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
once we pivoted away from the original strategy, things started to
change. Aligned with a superior strategy, our product development e
orts became magical y more productive—not because we were working
harder but because we were working smarter, aligned with our
customers’ real needs. Positive changes in metrics became the
quantitative validation that our learning was real. This was critical
y important because we could show our stakeholders—employees,
investors, and ourselves—that we were making genuine progress, not
deluding ourselves. It is also the right way to think about
productivity in a startup: not in terms of how</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	way
to think about productivity in a startup: not in terms of how much
stu we are building but in terms of how much validated learning we’re
get ing for our ef orts.4</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, in one early experiment, we changed our entire website, home
page, and product registration ow to replace</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“avatar
chat” with “3D instant messaging.” New customers were split
automatical y between these two versions of the site; half saw one,
and half saw the other. We were able to measure the di erence in
behavior between the two groups. Not only were the people in the
experimental group more likely to sign up for the product, they were
more likely to become long-term paying customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
had plenty of failed experiments too. During one period in which we
believed that customers weren’t using the product because they
didn’t understand its many bene ts, we went so far as to pay
customer service agents to act as virtual tour guides for new
customers. Unfortunately, customers who got that VIP treatment were
no more likely to become active or paying customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Even
after ditching the IM add-on strategy, it stil took months to
understand why it hadn’t worked. After our pivot and many failed
experiments, we nal y gured out this insight: customers wanted to use
IMVU to make new friends online. Our customers intuitively grasped
something that we were slow to realize. Al the existing social
products online were centered on customers’ real-life identity.
IMVU’s avatar technology, however, was uniquely wel suited to help
people get to know each other online without compromising safety or
opening themselves up to identity theft.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Once
we formed this hypothesis, our experiments became much more likely to
produce positive results. Whenever we would change the product to
make it easier for people to nd and keep new friends, we discovered
that customers were more likely to engage.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is true startup productivity: systematical y guring out the right
things to build.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
were just a few experiments among hundreds that we ran week in and
week out as we started to learn which customers would use the product
and why. Each bit of knowledge we</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	would
use the product and why. Each bit of knowledge we gathered suggested
new experiments to run, which moved our metrics closer and closer to
our goal.</p>

AUDACITY OF ZERO</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Despite
IMVU’s early success, our gross numbers were stil pret y smal .
Unfortunately, because of the traditional way businesses are
evaluated, this is a dangerous situation. The irony is that it is
often easier to raise money or acquire other resources when you have
zero revenue, zero customers, and zero traction than when you have a
smal amount. Zero invites imagination, but smal numbers invite
questions about whether large numbers wil ever materialize.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Everyone
knows (or thinks he or she knows) stories of products that achieved
breakthrough success overnight. As long as nothing has been released
and no data have been col ected, it is stil possible to imagine
overnight success in the future. Smal numbers pour cold water on that
hope.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
phenomenon creates a brutal incentive: postpone get ing any data
until you are certain of success. Of course, as we’l see, such
delays have the unfortunate e ect of increasing the amount of wasted
work, decreasing essential feedback, and dramatical y increasing the
risk that a startup wil build something nobody wants.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
releasing a product and hoping for the best is not a good plan
either, because this incentive is real. When we launched IMVU, we
were ignorant of this problem. Our earliest investors and advisers
thought it was quaint that we had a $300-per-month revenue plan at
rst. But after several months with our revenue hovering around $500
per month, some began to lose faith, as did some of our advisers,
employees, and even spouses. In fact, at one point, some investors
were seriously recommending that we pul the product out of the market
and return to stealth mode.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Fortunately,
as we pivoted and experimented, incorporating what we learned into
our product development and marketing e orts, our numbers started to
improve.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	our
numbers started to improve.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	But
not by much! On the one hand, we were lucky to see a growth pat ern
that started to look like the famous hockey stick graph. On the other
hand, the graph went up only to a few thousand dol ars per month.
These early graphs, although promising, were not by themselves su
cient to combat the loss of faith caused by our early failure, and we
lacked the language of validated learning to provide an alternative
concept to ral y around.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
were quite fortunate that some of our early investors understood its
importance and were wil ing to look beyond our smal gross numbers to
see the real progress we were making.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	(You’l
see the exact same graphs they did in Chapter 7.) Thus, we can
mitigate the waste that happens because of the audacity of zero with
validated learning. What we needed to demonstrate was that our
product development e orts were leading us toward massive success
without giving in to the temptation to fal back on vanity metrics and
“success theater”—the work we do to make ourselves look
successful. We could have tried marketing gimmicks, bought a Super
Bowl ad, or tried amboyant public relations (PR) as a way of juicing
our gross numbers. That would have given investors the il usion of
traction, but only for a short time. Eventual y, the fundamentals of
the business would win out and the PR bump would pass. Because we
would have squandered precious resources on theatrics instead of
progress, we would have been in real trouble.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Sixty
mil ion avatars later, IMVU is stil going strong. Its legacy is not
just a great product, an amazing team, and promising nancial results
but a whole new way of measuring the progress of startups.</p>

BEYOND IMVU</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
have had many opportunities to teach the IMVU story as a business
case ever since Stanford’s Graduate School of Business wrote an o
cial study about IMVU’s early years.5 The case is now part of the
entrepreneurship curriculum at several business schools, including
Harvard Business School, where I serve as an</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	including
Harvard Business School, where I serve as an entrepreneur in
residence. I’ve also told these stories at countless workshops,
lectures, and conferences.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Every
time I teach the IMVU story, students have an overwhelming temptation
to focus on the tactics it il ustrates: launching a low-quality early
prototype, charging customers from day one, and using low-volume
revenue targets as a way to drive accountability. These are useful
techniques, but they are not the moral of the story. There are too
many exceptions. Not every kind of customer wil accept a low-quality
prototype, for example. If the students are more skeptical, they may
argue that the techniques do not apply to their industry or
situation, but work only because IMVU is a software company, a
consumer Internet business, or a non-mission-critical application.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	None
of these takeaways is especial y useful. The Lean Startup is not a
col ection of individual tactics. It is a principled approach to new
product development. The only way to make sense of its
recommendations is to understand the underlying principles that make
them work. As we’l see in later chapters, the Lean Startup model
has been applied to a wide variety of businesses and industries:
manufacturing, clean tech, restaurants, and even laundry.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
tactics from the IMVU story may or may not make sense in your
particular business.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead,
the way forward is to learn to see every startup in any industry as a
grand experiment. The question is not “Can this product be built?”
In the modern economy, almost any product that can be imagined can be
built. The more pertinent questions are</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Should
this product be built?” and “Can we build a sustainable business
around this set of products and services?” To answer those
questions, we need a method for systematical y breaking down a
business plan into its component parts and testing each part
empirical y.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
other words, we need the scienti c method. In the Lean Startup model,
every product, every feature, every marketing campaign—everything a
startup does—is understood to be an experiment designed to achieve
validated learning. This experimental approach works across
industries and sectors, as we’l</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Icome
across many startups that are struggling to answer the fol owing
questions: Which customer opinions should we listen to, if any? How
should we prioritize across the many features we could build? Which
features are essential to the product’s success and which are ancil
ary? What can be changed safely, and what might anger customers? What
might please today’s customers at the expense of tomorrow’s? What
should we work on next?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
are some of the questions teams struggle to answer if they have fol
owed the “let’s just ship a product and see what happens”</p>

I cal this the “just do it” school of entrepreneurship after
Nike’s famous slogan.1 Unfortunately, if the plan is to see what
happens, a team is guaranteed to succeed—at seeing what happens</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	—but
won’t necessarily gain validated learning. This is one of the most
important lessons of the scienti c method: if you cannot fail, you
cannot learn.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>FROM
ALCHEMY TO SCIENCE</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Lean Startup methodology reconceives a startup’s e orts as
experiments that test its strategy to see which parts are bril iant
and which are crazy. A true experiment fol ows the scienti c method.
It begins with a clear hypothesis that makes predictions about what
is supposed to happen. It then tests those predictions empirical y.
Just as scienti c experimentation is informed by theory, startup
experimentation is guided by the startup’s vision. The goal of
every</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	experimentation
is guided by the startup’s vision. The goal of every startup
experiment is to discover how to build a sustainable business around
that vision.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Think
Big, Start Smal</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Zappos
is the world’s largest online shoe store, with annual gross sales
in excess of $1 bil ion. It is known as one of the most successful,
customer-friendly e-commerce businesses in the world, but it did not
start that way.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Founder
Nick Swinmurn was frustrated because there was no central online site
with a great selection of shoes. He envisioned a new and superior
retail experience. Swinmurn could have waited a long time, insisting
on testing his complete vision complete with warehouses, distribution
partners, and the promise of signi cant sales. Many early e-commerce
pioneers did just that, including infamous dot-com failures such as
Webvan and Pets.com.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead,
he started by running an experiment. His hypothesis was that
customers were ready and wil ing to buy shoes online. To test it, he
began by asking local shoe stores if he could take pictures of their
inventory. In exchange for permission to take the pictures, he would
post the pictures online and come back to buy the shoes at ful price
if a customer bought them online.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Zappos
began with a tiny, simple product. It was designed to answer one
question above al : is there already su cient demand for a superior
online shopping experience for shoes? However, a wel -designed
startup experiment like the one Zappos began with does more than test
a single aspect of a business plan. In the course of testing this rst
assumption, many other assumptions were tested as wel . To sel the
shoes, Zappos had to interact with customers: taking payment,
handling returns, and dealing with customer support. This is
decidedly di erent from market research. If Zappos had relied on
existing market research or conducted a survey, it could have asked
what customers thought they wanted. By building a product instead,
albeit a simple one, the company learned much more:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
It had more accurate data about customer demand because it was
observing real customer behavior, not asking hypothetical questions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
It put itself in a position to interact with real customers and learn
about their needs. For example, the business plan might cal for
discounted pricing, but how are customer perceptions of the product
af ected by the discounting strategy?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
It al owed itself to be surprised when customers behaved in
unexpected ways, revealing information Zappos might not have known to
ask about. For example, what if customers returned the shoes?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Zappos’
initial experiment provided a clear, quanti able outcome: either a su
cient number of customers would buy the shoes or they would not. It
also put the company in a position to observe, interact with, and
learn from real customers and partners.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
qualitative learning is a necessary companion to quantitative
testing. Although the early e orts were decidedly smal -scale, that
did not prevent the huge Zappos vision from being realized. In fact,
in 2009 Zappos was acquired by the e-commerce giant Amazon.com for a
reported $1.2 bil ion.2</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Corporate
guidelines encourage every employee to spend up to four hours a month
of company time volunteering in his or her community; that volunteer

volunteering was Caroline’s priority. Because of its talent and
values, HP’s combined workforce has the potential to have a
monumental positive impact. A designer could help a nonpro t with a

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Caroline’s
project is just beginning, and most employees do not know that this
volunteering policy exists, and only a tiny fraction take advantage
of it. Most of the volunteering has been of the low-impact variety,
involving manual labor, even when the volunteers were highly trained
experts. Barlerin’s vision is to take the hundreds of thousands of
employees in the company and transform them into a force for social
good.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is the kind of corporate initiative undertaken every day at companies
around the world. It doesn’t look like a startup by the
conventional de nition or what we see in the movies. On the surface
it seems to be suited to traditional management and planning.
However, I hope the discussion in Chapter 2 has prompted you to be a
lit le suspicious. Here’s how we might analyze this project using
the Lean Startup framework.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Caroline’s
project faces extreme uncertainty: there had never been a volunteer
campaign of this magnitude at HP before. How con dent should she be
that she knows the real reasons people aren’t volunteering? Most
important, how much does she real y know about how to change the
behavior of hundreds of thousand people in more than 170 countries?
Barlerin’s goal is to inspire her col eagues to make the world a
bet er place. Looked at that way, her plan seems ful of untested
assumptions—and a lot of vision.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
accordance with traditional management practices, Barlerin is
spending time planning, get ing buy-in from various departments and
other managers, and preparing a road map of initiatives for the rst
eighteen months of her project. She also has a strong accountability
framework with metrics for the impact her project should have on the
company over the next four years. Like many entrepreneurs, she has a
business plan that lays out her intentions nicely. Yet despite al
that work, she is—so far—creating one-o</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	nicely.
Yet despite al that work, she is—so far—creating one-o wins and
no closer to knowing if her vision wil be able to scale.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	One
assumption, for example, might be that the company’s long-standing
values included a commitment to improving the community but that
recent economic trouble had resulted in an increased companywide
strategic focus on short-term pro tability.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Perhaps
longtime employees would feel a desire to rea rm their values of
giving back to the community by volunteering. A second assumption
could be that they would nd it more satisfying and therefore more
sustainable to use their actual workplace skil s in a volunteer
capacity, which would have a greater impact on behalf of the
organizations to which they donated their time. Also lurking within
Caroline’s plans are many practical assumptions about employees’
wil ingness to take the time to volunteer, their level of commitment
and desire, and the way to best reach them with her message.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Lean Startup model o ers a way to test these hypotheses rigorously,
immediately, and thoroughly. Strategic planning takes months to
complete; these experiments could begin immediately.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	By
starting smal , Caroline could prevent a tremendous amount of waste
down the road without compromising her overal vision.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Here’s
what it might look like if Caroline were to treat her project as an
experiment.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Break
It Down</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
rst step would be to break down the grand vision into its component
parts. The two most important assumptions entrepreneurs make are what
I cal the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
value hypothesis tests whether a product or service real y delivers
value to customers once they are using it. What’s a good indicator
that employees nd donating their time valuable? We could survey them
to get their opinion, but that would not be very accurate because
most people have a hard time assessing their feelings objectively.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	feelings
objectively.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Experiments
provide a more accurate gauge. What could we see in real time that
would serve as a proxy for the value participants were gaining from
volunteering? We could nd opportunities for a smal number of
employees to volunteer and then look at the retention rate of those
employees. How many of them sign up to volunteer again? When an
employee voluntarily invests their time and at ention in this
program, that is a strong indicator that they find it valuable.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
the growth hypothesis, which tests how new customers wil discover a
product or service, we can do a similar analysis. Once the program is
up and running, how wil it spread among the employees, from initial
early adopters to mass adoption throughout the company? A likely way
this program could expand is through viral growth. If that is true,
the most important thing to measure is behavior: would the early
participants actively spread the word to other employees?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
this case, a simple experiment would involve taking a very smal
number—a dozen, perhaps—of existing long-term employees and
providing an exceptional volunteer opportunity for them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Because
Caroline’s hypothesis was that employees would be motivated by
their desire to live up to HP’s historical commitment to community
service, the experiment would target employees who felt the greatest
sense of disconnect between their daily routine and the company’s
expressed values. The point is not to nd the average customer but to
nd early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product
most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes
and are especial y eager to give feedback.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Next,
using a technique I cal the concierge minimum viable product
(described in detail in Chapter 6), Caroline could make sure the
first few participants had an experience that was as good as she
could make it, completely aligned with her vision. Unlike in a focus
group, her goal would be to measure what the customers actual y did.
For example, how many of the rst volunteers actual y complete their
volunteer assignments? How many volunteer a second time? How many are
wil ing to recruit a col eague to</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	second
time? How many are wil ing to recruit a col eague to participate in a
subsequent volunteer activity?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Additional
experiments can expand on this early feedback and learning. For
example, if the growth model requires that a certain percentage of
participants share their experiences with col eagues and encourage
their participation, the degree to which that takes place can be
tested even with a very smal sample of people. If ten people complete
the rst experiment, how many do we expect to volunteer again? If they
are asked to recruit a col eague, how many do we expect wil do so?
Remember that these are supposed to be the kinds of early adopters
with the most to gain from the program.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Put
another way, what if al ten early adopters decline to volunteer
again? That would be a highly signi cant—and very negative—result.
If the numbers from such early experiments don’t look promising,
there is clearly a problem with the strategy. That doesn’t mean
it’s time to give up; on the contrary, it means it’s time to get
some immediate qualitative feedback about how to improve the program.
Here’s where this kind of experimentation has an advantage over
traditional market research. We don’t have to commission a survey
or nd new people to interview. We already have a cohort of people to
talk to as wel as knowledge about their actual behavior: the
participants in the initial experiment.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
entire experiment could be conducted in a mat er of weeks, less than
one-tenth the time of the traditional strategic planning process.
Also, it can happen in paral el with strategic planning while the
plan is stil being formulated. Even when experiments produce a
negative result, those failures prove instructive and can in uence
the strategy. For example, what if no volunteers can be found who are
experiencing the con ict of values within the organization that was
such an important assumption in the business plan? If so,
congratulations: it’s time to pivot (a concept that is explored in
more detail in Chapter 8).3</p>

from that experience, Cook took a di erent approach when he led his
team through the development of a new set of features for a product
that makes it easier to share photos taken at an event. They believed
that an online “event album” would provide a way for people who
at ended a wedding, a conference, or another gathering to share
photos with other at endees. Unlike other online photo sharing
services, Kodak Gal ery’s event album would have strong privacy
controls, assuring that the photos would be shared only with people
who at ended the same event.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
a break with the past, Cook led the group through a process of
identifying risks and assumptions before building anything and then
testing those assumptions experimental y.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
were two main hypotheses underlying the proposed event album:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
The team assumed that customers would want to create the albums in
the first place.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
It assumed that event participants would upload photos to event
albums created by friends or col eagues.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Kodak Gal ery team built a simple prototype of the event album. It
lacked many features—so many, in fact, that the team was reluctant
to show it to customers. However, even at that early stage, al owing
customers to use the prototype helped the team refute their
hypotheses. First, creating an album was not as easy as the team had
predicted; none of the early customers were able to create one.
Further, customers complained that the early product version lacked
essential features.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Those
negative results demoralized the team. The usability</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Those
negative results demoralized the team. The usability problems
frustrated them, as did customer complains about missing features,
many of which matched the original road map. Cook explained that even
though the product was missing features, the project was not a
failure. The initial product— aws and al —</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	con
rmed that users did have the desire to create event albums, which was
extremely valuable information. Where customers complained about
missing features, this suggested that the team was on the right
track. The team now had early evidence that those features were in
fact important. What about features that were on the road map but
that customers didn’t complain about? Maybe those features weren’t
as important as they initial y seemed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Through
a beta launch the team continued to learn and iterate.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	While
the early users were enthusiastic and the numbers were promising, the
team made a major discovery. Through the use of online surveying tool
KISSinsights, the team learned that many customers wanted to be able
to arrange the order of pictures before they would invite others to
contribute. Knowing they weren’t ready to launch, Cook held o his
division’s general manager by explaining how iterating and
experimenting before beginning the marketing campaign would yield far
bet er results. In a world where marketing launch dates were often
set months in advance, waiting until the team had real y solved the
problem was a break from the past.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
process represented a dramatic change for Kodak Gal ery; employees
were used to being measured on their progress at completing tasks. As
Cook says, “Success is not delivering a feature; success is
learning how to solve the customer’s problem.”4</p>

VILLAGE LAUNDRY SERVICE</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
India, due to the cost of a washing machine, less than seven percent
of the population have one in their homes. Most people either hand
wash their clothing at home or pay a Dhobi to do it for them. Dhobis

dry, which takes two to seven days. The result? Clothes are returned
in about ten days and are probably not that clean.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Akshay
Mehra had been working at Procter &amp; Gamble Singapore for eight
years when he sensed an opportunity. As the brand manager of the Tide
and Pantene brands for India and ASEAN</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	countries,
he thought he could make laundry services available to people who
previously could not a ord them. Returning to India, Akshay joined
the Vil age Laundry Services (VLS), created by Innosight Ventures.
VLS began a series of experiments to test its business assumptions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
their rst experiment, VLS mounted a consumer-grade laundry machine on
the back of a pickup truck parked on a street corner in Bangalore.
The experiment cost less than $8,000 and had the simple goal of
proving that people would hand over their laundry and pay to have it
cleaned. The entrepreneurs did not clean the laundry on the truck,
which was more for marketing and show, but took it o -site to be
cleaned and brought it back to their customers by the end of the day.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
VLS team continued the experiment for a week, parking the truck on di
erent street corners, digging deeper to discover al they could about
their potential customers. They wanted to know how they could
encourage people to come to the truck. Did cleaning speed mat er? Was
cleanliness a concern? What were people asking for when they left
their laundry with them? They discovered that customers were happy to
give them their laundry to clean.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
those customers were suspicious of the washing machine mounted on the
back of the truck, concerned that VLS would take their laundry and
run. To address that concern, VLS created a slightly more substantial
mobile cart that looked more like a kiosk.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	VLS
also experimented with parking the carts in front of a local
minimarket chain. Further iterations helped VLS gure out which
services people were most interested in and what price they were wil
ing to pay. They discovered that customers often wanted their clothes
ironed and were wil ing to pay double the price to get their laundry
back in four hours rather than twenty-four hours.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
a result of those early experiments, VLS created an end</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
a result of those early experiments, VLS created an end product that
was a three-foot by four-foot mobile kiosk that included an energy-e
cient, consumer-grade washing machine, a dryer, and an extra-long
extension cord. The kiosk used Western detergents and was supplied
daily with fresh clean water delivered by VLS.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Since
then, the Vil age Laundry Service has grown substantial y, with
fourteen locations operational in Bangalore, Mysore, and Mumbai. As
CEO Akshay Mehra shared with me, “We have serviced 116,000 kgs. in

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	percent

LEAN STARTUP IN GOVERNMENT?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	On
July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd–Frank Wal Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act into law. One of its landmark
provisions created a new federal agency, the Consumer Federal
Protection Bureau (CFPB). This agency is tasked with protecting
American citizens from predatory lending by nancial services
companies such as credit card companies, student lenders, and payday
loan o ces. The plan cal s for it to accomplish this by set ing up a
cal center where trained case workers wil eld cal s directly from the
public.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Left
to its own devices, a new government agency would probably hire a
large sta with a large budget to develop a plan that is expensive and
time-consuming. However, the CFPB is considering doing things dif
erently. Despite its $500 mil ion budget and high-profile origins,
the CPFB is real y a startup.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	President
Obama tasked his chief technology o cer, Aneesh Chopra, with col
ecting ideas for how to set up the new startup agency, and that is
how I came to be involved. On one of Chopra’s visits to Silicon Val
ey, he invited a number of entrepreneurs to make suggestions for ways
to cultivate a startup mentality in the new agency. In particular,
his focus was on leveraging technology</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	new
agency. In particular, his focus was on leveraging technology and
innovation to make the agency more e cient, cost-e ective, and
thorough.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	My
suggestion was drawn straight from the principles of this chapter:
treat the CFPB as an experiment, identify the elements of the plan
that are assumptions rather than facts, and gure out ways to test
them. Using these insights, we could build a minimum viable product
and have the agency up and running—on a micro scale—</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	long
before the of icial plan was set in motion.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
number one assumption underlying the current plan is that once
Americans know they can cal the CFPB for help with nancial fraud and
abuse, there wil be a signi cant volume of citizens who do that. This
sounds reasonable, as it is based on market research about the amount
of fraud that a ects Americans each year. However, despite al that
research, it is stil an assumption. If the actual cal volume di ers
markedly from that in the plan, it wil require signi cant revision.
What if Americans who are subjected to nancial abuse don’t view
themselves as victims and therefore don’t seek help? What if they
have very di erent notions of what problems are important? What if
they cal the agency seeking help for problems that are outside its
purview?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Once
the agency is up and running with a $500 mil ion budget and a
correspondingly large sta , altering the plan wil be expensive and
time-consuming, but why wait to get feedback? To start experimenting
immediately, the agency could start with the creation of a simple
hotline number, using one of the new breed of low-cost and fast setup
platforms such as Twilio. With a few hours’</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	work,
they could add simple voice prompts, o ering cal ers a menu of
nancial problems to choose from. In the rst version, the prompts
could be drawn straight from the existing research. Instead of a
caseworker on the line, each prompt could o er the cal er useful
information about how to solve her or his problem.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead
of marketing this hotline to the whole country, the agency could run
the experiment in a much more limited way: start with a smal
geographic area, perhaps as smal as a few city blocks, and instead of
paying for expensive television or radio advertising to let people
know about the service, use highly targeted advertising.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	people
know about the service, use highly targeted advertising.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Flyers
on bil boards, newspaper advertisements to those blocks, or special y
targeted online ads would be a good start. Since the target area is
so smal , they could a ord to pay a premium to create a high level of
awareness in the target zone. The total cost would remain quite smal
.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
a comprehensive solution to the problem of nancial abuse, this
minimum viable product is not very good compared with what a $500 mil
ion agency could accomplish. But it is also not very expensive. This
product could be built in a mat er of days or weeks, and the whole
experiment probably would cost only a few thousand dol ars.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
we would learn from this experiment would be invaluable.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	On
the basis of the selections of those rst cal ers, the agency could
immediately start to get a sense of what kinds of problems Americans
believe they have, not just what they “should” have. The agency
could begin to test marketing messages: What motivates people to cal
? It could start to extrapolate real-world trends: What percentage of
people in the target area actual y cal ? The extrapolation would not
be perfect, but it would establish a baseline behavior that would be
far more accurate than market research.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
important, this product would serve as a seed that could germinate
into a much more elaborate service. With this beginning, the agency
could engage in a continuous process of improvement, slowly but
surely adding more and bet er solutions. Eventual y, it would sta the
hotline with caseworkers, perhaps at rst addressing only one category
of problems, to give the caseworkers the best chance of success. By
the time the o cial plan was ready for implementation, this early
service could serve as a real-world template.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
CFPB is just get ing started, but already they are showing signs of
fol owing an experimental approach. For example, instead of doing a
geographical y limited rol out, they are segmenting their rst
products by use case. They have established a preliminary order of
nancial products to provide consumer services for, with credit cards
coming rst. As their rst experiment unfolds, they wil</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	credit
cards coming rst. As their rst experiment unfolds, they wil have the
opportunity to closely monitor al of the other complaints and
consumer feedback they receive. This data wil in uence the depth,
breadth, and sequence of future of erings.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
David Forrest, the CFPB’s chief technology o cer, told me,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Our
goal is to give American citizens an easy way to tel us about the
problems they see out there in the consumer nancial marketplace. We
have an opportunity to closely monitor what the public is tel ing us
and react to new information. Markets change al the time and our job
is to change with them.”6</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
entrepreneurs and managers pro led in this book are smart, capable,
and extremely results-oriented. In many cases, they are in the midst
of building an organization in a way consistent with the best
practices of current management thinking. They face the same chal

As we’ve seen, even the seasoned managers and executives at the

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Their

its faith in wel -researched plans. Remember, planning is a tool that
only works in the presence of a long and stable operating history.
And yet, do any of us feel that the world around us is get ing more

critical to startup success. My hope is that this book wil help
managers and entrepreneurs make this change.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>STEER</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	How
Vision Leads to Steering At its heart, a startup is a catalyst that
transforms ideas into products. As customers interact with those
products, they generate feedback and data. The feedback is both
qualitative (such as what they like and don’t like) and
quantitative (such as how many people use it and nd it valuable). As
we saw in Part One, the products a startup builds are real y
experiments; the learning about how to build a sustainable business
is the outcome of those experiments. For startups, that information
is much more important than dol ars, awards, or mentions in the
press, because it can influence and reshape the next set of ideas.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
can visualize this three-step process with this simple diagram:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	 
<img src="205812606c9480f20c08cca756509bf8_html_316e8131606cc78f.jpg" name="Image12" align="bottom" width="235" height="282" border="0"/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop is at the core of the Lean Startup
model. In Part Two, we wil examine it in great detail.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Many
people have professional training that emphasizes one element of this
feedback loop. For engineers, it’s learning to build things as e
ciently as possible. Some managers are experts at strategizing and
learning at the whiteboard. Plenty of entrepreneurs focus their
energies on the individual nouns: having the best product idea or the
best-designed initial product or obsessing over data and metrics. The
truth is that none of these activities by itself is of paramount
importance. Instead, we need to focus our energies on minimizing the
total time through this feedback loop. This is the essence of
steering a startup and is the subject of Part Two. We wil walk
through a complete turn of the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop,
discussing each of the components in detail.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
purpose of Part One was to explore the importance of learning as the
measure of progress for a startup. As I hope is</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	learning
as the measure of progress for a startup. As I hope is evident by
now, by focusing our energies on validated learning, we can avoid
much of the waste that plagues startups today. As in lean
manufacturing, learning where and when to invest energy results in
saving time and money.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
apply the scienti c method to a startup, we need to identify which
hypotheses to test. I cal the riskiest elements of a startup’s
plan, the parts on which everything depends, leap-of-faith
assumptions. The two most important assumptions are the value
hypothesis and the growth hypothesis. These give rise to tuning
variables that control a startup’s engine of growth. Each iteration
of a startup is an at empt to rev this engine to see if it wil turn.
Once it is running, the process repeats, shifting into higher and
higher gears.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Once
clear on these leap-of-faith assumptions, the rst step is to enter
the Build phase as quickly as possible with a minimum viable product
(MVP). The MVP is that version of the product that enables a ful turn
of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with a minimum amount of e ort and
the least amount of development time. The minimum viable product
lacks many features that may prove essential later on. However, in
some ways, creating a MVP requires extra work: we must be able to
measure its impact. For example, it is inadequate to build a
prototype that is evaluated solely for internal quality by engineers
and designers. We also need to get it in front of potential customers
to gauge their reactions. We may even need to try sel ing them the
prototype, as we’l soon see.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
we enter the Measure phase, the biggest chal enge wil be determining
whether the product development e orts are leading to real progress.
Remember, if we’re building something that nobody wants, it doesn’t
much mat er if we’re doing it on time and on budget. The method I
recommend is cal ed innovation accounting, a quantitative approach
that al ows us to see whether our engine-tuning e orts are bearing
fruit. It also al ows us to create learning milestones, which are an
alternative to traditional business and product milestones. Learning
milestones are useful for entrepreneurs as a way of assessing their
progress accurately and objectively; they are also invaluable to
managers and investors who</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	objectively;
they are also invaluable to managers and investors who must hold
entrepreneurs accountable. However, not al metrics are created equal,
and in Chapter 7 I’l clarify the danger of vanity metrics in
contrast to the nuts-and-bolts usefulness of actionable metrics,
which help to analyze customer behavior in ways that support
innovation accounting.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Final
y, and most important, there’s the pivot. Upon completing the
Build-Measure-Learn loop, we confront the most di cult question any
entrepreneur faces: whether to pivot the original strategy or
persevere. If we’ve discovered that one of our hypotheses is false,
it is time to make a major change to a new strategic hypothesis.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Lean Startup method builds capital-e cient companies because it al
ows startups to recognize that it’s time to pivot sooner, creating
less waste of time and money. Although we write the feedback loop as
Build-Measure-Learn because the activities happen in that order, our
planning real y works in the reverse order: we gure out what we need
to learn, use innovation accounting to gure out what we need to
measure to know if we are gaining validated learning, and then gure
out what product we need to build to run that experiment and get that
measurement. Al of the techniques in Part Two are designed to
minimize the total time through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback
loop.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	5LEAP</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
2004, three col ege sophomores arrived in Silicon Val ey with their
edgling col ege social network. It was live on a handful of col ege
campuses. It was not the market-leading social network or even the
rst col ege social network; other companies had launched sooner and
with more features. With 150,000 registered users, it made very lit
le revenue, yet that summer they raised their rst $500,000 in venture
capital. Less than a year later, they raised an additional $12.7 mil
ion.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Of
course, by now you’ve guessed that these three col ege sophomores
were Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes of Facebook.
Their story is now world famous. Many things about it are remarkable,
but I’d like to focus on only one: how Facebook was able to raise
so much money when its actual usage was so smal .1</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	By
al accounts, what impressed investors the most were two facts about
Facebook’s early growth. The first fact was the raw amount of time
Facebook’s active users spent on the site. More than half of the
users came back to the site every single day.2 This is an example of
how a company can validate its value hypothesis—that customers nd
the product valuable. The second impressive thing about Facebook’s
early traction was the rate at which it had taken over its rst few
col ege campuses. The rate of growth was staggering: Facebook
launched on February 4, 2004, and by the end of that month almost
three-quarters of Harvard’s undergraduates were using it, without a
dol ar of marketing or advertising having been</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	using
it, without a dol ar of marketing or advertising having been spent.
In other words, Facebook also had validated its growth hypothesis.
These two hypotheses represent two of the most important
leap-of-faith questions any new startup faces.3</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	At
the time, I heard many people criticize Facebook’s early investors,
claiming that Facebook had “no business model” and only modest
revenues relative to the valuation o ered by its investors.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
saw in Facebook a return to the excesses of the dot-com era, when
companies with lit le revenue raised massive amounts of cash to
pursue a strategy of “at racting eyebal s” and “get ing big
fast.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Many
dot-com-era startups planned to make money later by sel ing the
eyebal s they had bought to other advertisers. In truth, those
dot-com failures were lit le more than middlemen, e ectively paying
money to acquire customers’ at ention and then planning to resel it
to others. Facebook was di erent, because it employed a di erent
engine of growth. It paid nothing for customer acquisition, and its
high engagement meant that it was accumulating massive amounts of
customer at ention every day. There was never any question that at
ention would be valuable to advertisers; the only question was how
much they would pay.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Many
entrepreneurs are at empting to build the next Facebook, yet when
they try to apply the lessons of Facebook and other famous startup
success stories, they quickly get confused. Is the lesson of Facebook
that startups should not charge customers money in the early days? Or
is it that startups should never spend money on marketing? These
questions cannot be answered in the abstract; there are an almost
infinite number of counterexamples for any technique. Instead, as we
saw in Part One, startups need to conduct experiments that help
determine what techniques wil work in their unique circumstances. For
startups, the role of strategy is to help figure out the right
questions to ask.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>STRATEGY

achieve the company’s vision. Because the assumptions haven’t
been proved to be true (they are assumptions, after al ) and in fact
are often erroneous, the goal of a startup’s early ef orts should
be to test them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
traditional business strategy excels at is helping managers identify
clearly what assumptions are being made in a particular business. The

in al entrepreneurial situations, is to perform that rigorous testing
without losing sight of the company’s overal vision.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Many
assumptions in a typical business plan are unexceptional.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
are wel -established facts drawn from past industry experience or
straightforward deductions. In Facebook’s case, it was clear that
advertisers would pay for customers’ at ention. Hidden among these
mundane details are a handful of assumptions that require more
courage to state—in the present tense—with a straight face: we
assume that customers have a signi cant desire to use a product like
ours, or we assume that supermarkets wil carry our product. Acting as
if these assumptions are true is a classic entrepreneur superpower.
They are cal ed leaps of faith precisely because the success of the
entire venture rests on them. If they are true, tremendous
opportunity awaits. If they are false, the startup risks total
failure.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
leaps of faith take the form of an argument by analogy. For example,
one business plan I remember argued as fol ows: “Just as the
development of progressive image loading al owed the widespread use
of the World Wide Web over dial-up, so too our progressive rendering
technology wil al ow our product to run on low-end personal
computers.” You probably have no idea what progressive image
loading or rendering is, and it doesn’t much mat er. But you know
the argument (perhaps you’ve even used it): Previous technology X
was used to win market Y because of at ribute Z. We have a new
technology X2 that wil enable us to win market Y2 because we too have
at ribute Z.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
problem with analogies like this is that they obscure the true leap
of faith. That is their goal: to make the business seem less risky.
They are used to persuade investors, employees, or partners to sign
on. Most entrepreneurs would cringe to see their leap of faith writ
en this way:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Large
numbers of people already wanted access to the World Wide Web. They
knew what it was, they could a ord it, but they could not get access
to it because the time it took to load images was too long. When
progressive image loading was introduced, it al owed people to get
onto the World Wide Web and tel their friends about it. Thus, company
X won market Y.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Similarly,
there is already a large number of potential customers who want
access to our product right now. They know they want it, they can a
ord it, but they cannot access it because the rendering is too slow.
When we debut our product with progressive rendering technology, they
wil ock to our software and tel their friends, and we wil win market
Y2.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
are several things to notice in this revised statement. First, it’s
important to identify the facts clearly. Is it real y true that
progressive image loading caused the adoption of the World Wide Web,
or was this just one factor among many? More important, is it real y
true that there are large numbers of potential customers out there
who want our solution right now? The earlier analogy was designed to
convince stakeholders that a reasonable rst step is to build the new
startup’s technology and see if customers wil use it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
restated approach should make clear that what is needed is to do some
empirical testing rst: let’s make sure that there real y are hungry
customers out there eager to embrace our new technology.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Analogs
and Antilogs</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
is nothing intrinsical y wrong with basing strategy on comparisons to
other companies and industries. In fact, that approach can help you
discover assumptions that are not real y leaps of faith. For example,
the venture capitalist Randy Komisar, whose book Get ing to Plan B
discussed the concept of leaps of faith in great detail, uses a
framework of “analogs” and “antilogs” to plot strategy.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	He
explains the analog-antilog concept by using the iPod as an example.
“If you were looking for analogs, you would have to look at the
Walkman,” he says. “It solved a critical question that Steve Jobs
never had to ask himself: Wil people listen to music in a public
place using earphones? We think of that as a nonsense question today,
but it is fundamental. When Sony asked the question, they did not
have the answer. Steve Jobs had [the answer]</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	in
the analog [version]” Sony’s Walkman was the analog. Jobs then
had to face the fact that although people were wil ing to download
music, they were not wil ing to pay for it. “Napster was an
antilog.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	That
antilog had to lead him to address his business in a particular way,”
Komisar says. “Out of these analogs and antilogs come a series of
unique, unanswered questions. Those are leaps of faith that I, as an
entrepreneur, am taking if I go through with this business venture.
They are going to make or break my business. In the iPod business,
one of those leaps of faith was that people would pay for music.”
Of course that leap of faith turned out to be correct.4</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Beyond
“The Right Place at the Right Time”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
are any number of famous entrepreneurs who made mil ions because they
seemed to be in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
for every successful entrepreneur who was in the right place in the
right time, there are many more who were there, too, in that right
place at the right time but stil managed to fail. Henry Ford was
joined by nearly ve hundred other entrepreneurs in the early
twentieth century. Imagine being an automobile entrepreneur, trained
in state-of-the-art engineering, on the ground oor of one of</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	trained
in state-of-the-art engineering, on the ground oor of one of the
biggest market opportunities in history. Yet the vast majority
managed to make no money at al .5 We saw the same phenomenon with
Facebook, which faced early competition from other col ege-based
social networks whose head start proved irrelevant.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
di erentiates the success stories from the failures is that the
successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the
tools to discover which parts of their plans were working bril iantly
and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Value
and Growth</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
we saw in the Facebook story, two leaps of faith stand above al
others: the value creation hypothesis and the growth hypothesis.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
rst step in understanding a new product or service is to gure out if
it is fundamental y value-creating or value-destroying. I use the
language of economics in referring to value rather than pro t,
because entrepreneurs include people who start not-for-pro t social
ventures, those in public sector startups, and internal change agents
who do not judge their success by pro t alone. Even more confusing,
there are many organizations that are wildly profitable in the short
term but ultimately value-destroying, such as the organizers of Ponzi
schemes, and fraudulent or misguided companies (e.g., Enron and
Lehman Brothers).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
similar thing is true for growth. As with value, it’s essential
that entrepreneurs understand the reasons behind a startup’s
growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
are many value-destroying kinds of growth that should be avoided. An
example would be a business that grows through continuous
fund-raising from investors and lots of paid advertising but does not
develop a value-creating product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Such
businesses are engaged in what I cal success theater, using the
appearance of growth to make it seem that they are successful.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	One
of the goals of innovation accounting, which is discussed in depth in
Chapter 7, is to help di erentiate these false startups from true
innovators. Traditional accounting judges new ventures by the same
standards it uses for established companies, but these</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	same
standards it uses for established companies, but these indications
are not reliable predictors of a startup’s future prospects.
Consider companies such as Amazon.com that racked up huge losses on
their way to breakthrough success.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Like
its traditional counterpart, innovation accounting requires that a
startup have and maintain a quantitative nancial model that can be
used to evaluate progress rigorously. However, in a startup’s
earliest days, there is not enough data to make an informed guess
about what this model might look like. A startup’s earliest
strategic plans are likely to be hunch- or intuition-guided, and that
is a good thing. To translate those instincts into data,
entrepreneurs must, in Steve Blank’s famous phrase, “get out of
the building” and start learning.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>GENCHI
GEMBUTSU</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
importance of basing strategic decisions on rsthand understanding of
customers is one of the core principles that underlies the Toyota
Production System. At Toyota, this goes by the Japanese term genchi
gembutsu, which is one of the most important phrases in the lean
manufacturing vocabulary. In English, it is usual y translated as a
directive to “go and see for yourself” so that business decisions
can be based on deep rsthand knowledge.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Je
rey Liker, who has extensively documented the “Toyota Way,”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	explains
it this way:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
my Toyota interviews, when I asked what distinguishes the Toyota Way
from other management approaches, the most common rst response was
genchi gembutsu</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	—whether
I was in manufacturing, product development, sales, distribution, or
public a airs. You cannot be sure you real y understand any part of
any business problem unless you go and see for yourself rsthand. It
is unacceptable to take anything for granted or to rely on the
reports of others.6</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
demonstrate, take a look at the development of Toyota’s Sienna
minivan for the 2004 model year. At Toyota, the manager responsible
for the design and development of a new model is cal ed the chief
engineer, a cross-functional leader who oversees the entire process
from concept to production. The 2004 Sienna was assigned to Yuji
Yokoya, who had very lit le experience in North America, which was
the Sienna’s primary market. To gure out how to improve the
minivan, he proposed an audacious entrepreneurial undertaking: a road
trip spanning al fty U.S.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	states,
al thirteen provinces and territories of Canada, and al parts of
Mexico. In al , he logged more than 53,000 miles of driving. In smal
towns and large cities, Yokoya would rent a current-model Sienna,
driving it in addition to talking to and observing real customers.
From those rsthand observations, Yokoya was able to start testing his
critical assumptions about what North American consumers wanted in a
minivan.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
is common to think of sel ing to consumers as easier than sel ing to
enterprises, because customers lack the complexity of multiple
departments and di erent people playing di erent roles in the
purchasing process. Yokoya discovered this was untrue for his
customers: “The parents and grandparents may own the minivan.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	But
it’s the kids who rule it. It’s the kids who occupy the rear
two-thirds of the vehicle. And it’s the kids who are the most
critical—</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	and
the most appreciative of their environment. If I learned anything in
my travels, it was the new Sienna would need kid appeal.”7
Identifying these assumptions helped guide the car’s development.
For example, Yokoya spent an unusual amount of the Sienna’s
development budget on internal comfort features, which are critical
to a long-distance family road trip (such trips are much more common
in America than in Japan).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
results were impressive, boosting the Sienna’s market share
dramatical y. The 2004 model’s sales were 60 percent higher than
those in 2003. Of course, a product like the Sienna is a classic
sustaining innovation, the kind that the world’s best-managed
established companies, such as Toyota, excel at. Entrepreneurs face</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	established
companies, such as Toyota, excel at. Entrepreneurs face a di erent
set of chal enges because they operate with much higher uncertainty.
While a company working on a sustaining innovation knows enough about
who and where their customers are to use genchi gembutsu to discover
what customers want, startups’ early contact with potential
customers merely reveals what assumptions require the most urgent
testing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>GET
OUT OF THE BUILDING</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Numbers
tel a compel ing story, but I always remind entrepreneurs that
metrics are people, too. No mat er how many intermediaries lie
between a company and its customers, at the end of the day, customers
are breathing, thinking, buying individuals. Their behavior is
measurable and changeable. Even when one is sel ing to large
institutions, as in a business-to-business model, it helps to
remember that those businesses are made up of individuals. Al
successful sales models depend on breaking down the monolithic view
of organizations into the disparate people that make them up.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
Steve Blank has been teaching entrepreneurs for years, the facts that
we need to gather about customers, markets, suppliers, and channels
exist only “outside the building.” Startups need extensive
contact with potential customers to understand them, so get out of
your chair and get to know them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
rst step in this process is to con rm that your leap-of-faith
questions are based in reality, that the customer has a signi cant
problem worth solving.8 When Scot Cook conceived Intuit in 1982, he
had a vision—at that time quite radical—that someday consumers
would use personal computers to pay bil s and keep track of expenses.
When Cook left his consulting job to take the entrepreneurial plunge,
he didn’t start with stacks of market research or in-depth analysis
at the whiteboard. Instead, he picked up two phone books: one for
Palo Alto, California, where he was living at the time, and the other
for Winnetka, Il inois.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Cal
ing people at random, he inquired if he could ask them a few
questions about the way they managed their nances. Those early</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	questions
about the way they managed their nances. Those early conversations
were designed to answer this leap-of-faith question: do people nd it
frustrating to pay bil s by hand? It turned out that they did, and
this early validation gave Cook the con rmation he needed to get
started on a solution.9</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Those
early conversations did not delve into the product features of a
proposed solution; that at empt would have been foolish. The average
consumers at that time were not conversant enough with personal
computers to have an opinion about whether they’d want to use them
in a new way. Those early conversations were with mainstream
customers, not early adopters. Stil , the conversations yielded a
fundamental insight: if Intuit could nd a way to solve this problem,
there could be a large mainstream audience on which it could build a
significant business.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Design
and the Customer Archetype</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
goal of such early contact with customers is not to gain definitive
answers. Instead, it is to clarify at a basic, coarse level that we
understand our potential customer and what problems they have. With
that understanding, we can craft a customer archetype, a brief
document that seeks to humanize the proposed target customer. This
archetype is an essential guide for product development and ensures
that the daily prioritization decisions that every product team must
make are aligned with the customer to whom the company aims to
appeal.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
are many techniques for building an accurate customer archetype that
have been developed over long years of practice in the design
community. Traditional approaches such as interaction design or
design thinking are enormously helpful. To me, it has always seemed
ironic that many of these approaches are highly experimental and
iterative, using techniques such as rapid prototyping and in-person
customer observations to guide designers’ work. Yet because of the
way design agencies traditional y have been compensated, al this work
culminates in a monolithic deliverable to the client. Al of a sudden,
the rapid</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	monolithic
deliverable to the client. Al of a sudden, the rapid learning and
experimentation stops; the assumption is that the designers have
learned al there is to know. For startups, this is an unworkable
model. No amount of design can anticipate the many complexities of
bringing a product to life in the real world.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
fact, a new breed of designers is developing brand-new techniques
under the banner of Lean User Experience (Lean UX).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
recognize that the customer archetype is a hypothesis, not a fact.
The customer pro le should be considered provisional until the
strategy has shown via validated learning that we can serve this type
of customer in a sustainable way.10</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>ANALYSIS
PARALYSIS</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
are two ever-present dangers when entrepreneurs conduct market
research and talk to customers. Fol owers of the just-do-it school of
entrepreneurship are impatient to get started and don’t want to
spend time analyzing their strategy. They’d rather start building
immediately, often after just a few cursory customer conversations.
Unfortunately, because customers don’t real y know what they want,
it’s easy for these entrepreneurs to delude themselves that they
are on the right path.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Other
entrepreneurs can fal victim to analysis paralysis, endlessly re ning
their plans. In this case, talking to customers, reading research
reports, and whiteboard strategizing are al equal y unhelpful. The
problem with most entrepreneurs’ plans is general y not that they
don’t fol ow sound strategic principles but that the facts upon
which they are based are wrong. Unfortunately, most of these errors
cannot be detected at the whiteboard because they depend on the
subtle interactions between products and customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
too much analysis is dangerous but none can lead to failure, how do
entrepreneurs know when to stop analyzing and start building? The
answer is a concept cal ed the minimum viable product, the subject of
Chapter 6.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	6TEST</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Groupon
is one of the fastest-growing companies of al time. Its name comes
from “group coupons,” an ingenious idea that has spawned an
entire industry of social commerce imitators.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
it didn’t start out successful. When customers took Groupon up on
its rst deal, a whopping twenty people bought two-for-one pizza in a
restaurant on the rst oor of the company’s Chicago of ices—hardly
a world-changing event.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
fact, Groupon wasn’t original y meant to be about commerce at al .
The founder, Andrew Mason, intended his company to become a “col
ective activism platform” cal ed The Point. Its goal was to bring
people together to solve problems they couldn’t solve on their own,
such as fund-raising for a cause or boycot ing a certain retailer.
The Point’s early results were disappointing, however, and at the
end of 2008 the founders decided to try something new. Although they
stil had grand ambitions, they were determined to keep the new
product simple. They built a minimum viable product. Does this sound
like a bil ion-dol ar company to you? Mason tel s the story:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
took a WordPress Blog and we skinned it to say Groupon and then every
day we would do a new post. It was total y ghet o. We would sel
T-shirts on the rst version of Groupon. We’d say in the write-up,
“This T-shirt wil come in the color red, size large. If you want a

was al FileMaker. We would run a script that would e-mail the coupon

in a day, and we’d send 500 PDFs to people with Apple Mail at the
same time. Real y until July of the rst year it was just a scrambling

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Contrary
to traditional product development, which usual y involves a long,

IMVU, when we were raising money from venture investors, we were
embarrassed. First of al , our product was stil buggy and
low-quality. Second, although we were proud of our business results,
they weren’t exactly earth-shat ering. The good news was that we
were on a hockey-stick-shaped growth curve. The bad news was that the
hockey stick went up to only about $8,000 per month of revenue. These
numbers were so low that we’d often have investors ask us, “What
are the units on these charts? Are those numbers in thousands?”
We’d have to reply, “No, sir, those are in ones.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
those early results were extremely signi cant in predicting IMVU’s
future path. As you’l see in Chapter 7, we were able to validate
two of our leap-of-faith assumptions: IMVU was providing value for
customers, and we had a working engine of growth. The gross numbers
were smal because we were sel ing the product to visionary early
customers cal ed early adopters. Before new products can be sold
successful y to the mass market, they have to be sold to early
adopters. These people are a special breed of customer. They
accept—in fact prefer—an 80 percent solution; you don’t need a
perfect solution to capture their interest.4</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Early
technology adopters lined up around the block for Apple’s original
iPhone even though it lacked basic features such as copy and paste,
3G Internet speed, and support for corporate e-mail.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Google’s
original search engine could answer queries about specialized topics

singing its praises.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Early
adopters use their imagination to l in what a product is missing.
They prefer that state of a airs, because what they care about above
al is being the rst to use or adopt a new product or technology. In
consumer products, it’s often the thril of being the rst one on the
block to show o a new basketbal shoe, music player, or cool phone. In
enterprise products, it’s often about gaining a competitive
advantage by taking a risk with something new that competitors don’t
have yet. Early adopters are suspicious of something that is too
polished: if it’s ready for everyone to adopt,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	of
something that is too polished: if it’s ready for everyone to
adopt, how much advantage can one get by being early? As a result,
additional features or polish beyond what early adopters demand is a
form of wasted resources and time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is a hard truth for many entrepreneurs to accept. After al , the
vision entrepreneurs keep in their heads is of a high-quality
mainstream product that wil change the world, not one used by a smal
niche of people who are wil ing to give it a shot before it’s
ready. That world-changing product is polished, slick, and ready for
prime time. It wins awards at trade shows and, most of al , is
something you can proudly show Mom and Dad. An early, buggy,
incomplete product feels like an unacceptable compromise. How many of
us were raised with the expectation that we would put our best work
forward? As one manager put it to me recently, “I know for me, the
MVP feels a lit le dangerous—in a good way—since I have always
been such a perfectionist.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Minimum
viable products range in complexity from extremely simple smoke tests
(lit le more than an advertisement) to actual early prototypes
complete with problems and missing features.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Deciding
exactly how complex an MVP needs to be cannot be done formulaical y.
It requires judgment. Luckily, this judgment is not di cult to
develop: most entrepreneurs and product development people dramatical
y overestimate how many features are needed in an MVP. When in doubt,
simplify.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, consider a service sold with a one-month free trial.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Before
a customer can use the service, he or she has to sign up for the
trial. One obvious assumption, then, of the business model is that
customers wil sign up for a free trial once they have a certain
amount of information about the service. A critical question to
consider is whether customers wil in fact sign up for the free trial
given a certain number of promised features (the value hypothesis).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Somewhere
in the business model, probably buried in a single cel in a
spreadsheet, it speci es the “percentage of customers who see the
free trial o er who then sign up.” Maybe in our projections we say
that this number should be 10 percent. If you think about it, this is
a leap-of-faith question. It real y should be represented in giant
let ers in a bold red font: WE ASSUME 10 PERCENT OF CUSTOMERS WILL
SIGN UP.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	giant
let ers in a bold red font: WE ASSUME 10 PERCENT OF CUSTOMERS WILL
SIGN UP.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
entrepreneurs approach a question like this by building the product
and then checking to see how customers react to it. I consider this
to be exactly backward because it can lead to a lot of waste. First,
if it turns out that we’re building something nobody wants, the
whole exercise wil be an avoidable expense of time and money. If
customers won’t sign up for the free trial, they’l never get to
experience the amazing features that await them. Even if they do sign
up, there are many other opportunities for waste. For example, how
many features do we real y need to include to appeal to early
adopters? Every extra feature is a form of waste, and if we delay the
test for these extra features, it comes with a tremendous potential
cost in terms of learning and cycle time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was
required to start learning is waste, no mat er how important it might
have seemed at the time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
demonstrate, I’l share several MVP techniques from actual Lean
Startups. In each case, you’l witness entrepreneurs avoiding the
temptation to overbuild and overpromise.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>THE
VIDEO MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Drew
Houston is the CEO of Dropbox, a Silicon Val ey company that makes an
extremely easy-to-use le-sharing tool. Instal its application, and a
Dropbox folder appears on your computer desktop. Anything you drag
into that folder is uploaded automatical y to the Dropbox service and
then instantly replicated across al your computers and devices.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
founding team was made up of engineers, as the product demanded signi
cant technical expertise to build. It required, for example,
integration with a variety of computer platforms and operating
systems: Windows, Macintosh, iPhone, Android, and so on. Each of
these implementations happens at a deep level of the system and
requires specialized know-how to make the user experience
exceptional. In fact, one of Dropbox’s biggest competitive
advantages is that the product works in such a seamless</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	competitive
advantages is that the product works in such a seamless way that the
competition struggles to emulate it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
are not the kind of people one would think of as marketing geniuses.
In fact, none of them had ever worked in a marketing job. They had
prominent venture capital backers and could have been expected to
apply the standard engineering thinking to building the business:
build it and they wil come. But Dropbox did something dif erent.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
paral el with their product development e orts, the founders wanted
feedback from customers about what real y mat ered to them. In
particular, Dropbox needed to test its leap-of-faith question: if we
can provide a superior customer experience, wil people give our
product a try? They believed—rightly, as it turned out—that le
synchronization was a problem that most people didn’t know they
had. Once you experience the solution, you can’t imagine how you
ever lived without it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is not the kind of entrepreneurial question you can ask or expect an
answer to in a focus group. Customers often don’t know what they
want, and they often had a hard time understanding Dropbox when the
concept was explained. Houston learned this the hard way when he
tried to raise venture capital. In meeting after meeting, investors
would explain that this “market space” was crowded with existing
products, none of them had made very much money, and the problem
wasn’t a very important one. Drew would ask: “Have you personal y
tried those other products?” When they would say yes, he’d ask:
“Did they work seamlessly for you?” The answer was almost always
no. Yet in meeting after meeting, the venture capitalists could not
imagine a world in line with Drew’s vision. Drew, in contrast,
believed that if the software “just worked like magic,” customers
would flock to it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
chal enge was that it was impossible to demonstrate the working
software in a prototype form. The product required that they overcome
signi cant technical hurdles; it also had an online service component
that required high reliability and availability. To avoid the risk of
waking up after years of development with a product nobody wanted,
Drew did something unexpectedly easy: he made a video.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	made
a video.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
video is banal, a simple three-minute demonstration of the technology
as it is meant to work, but it was targeted at a community of
technology early adopters. Drew narrates the video personal y, and as
he’s narrating, the viewer is watching his screen.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
he describes the kinds of les he’d like to synchronize, the viewer
can watch his mouse manipulate his computer. Of course, if you’re
paying at ention, you start to notice that the files he’s moving
around are ful of in-jokes and humorous references that were
appreciated by this community of early adopters. Drew recounted,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“It
drove hundreds of thousands of people to the website. Our beta
waiting list went from 5,000 people to 75,000 people literal y
overnight. It total y blew us away.” Today, Dropbox is one of
Silicon Val ey’s hot est companies, rumored to be worth more than
$1 bil ion.5</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
this case, the video was the minimum viable product. The MVP
validated Drew’s leap-of-faith assumption that customers wanted the
product he was developing not because they said so in a focus group
or because of a hopeful analogy to another business, but because they
actual y signed up.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>THE
CONCIERGE MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Consider
another kind of MVP technique: the concierge MVP. To understand how
this technique works, meet Manuel Rosso, the CEO</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	of
an Austin, Texas–based startup cal ed Food on the Table. Food on
the Table creates weekly meal plans and grocery lists that are based
on food you and your family enjoy, then hooks into your local grocery
stores to find the best deals on the ingredients.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	After
you sign up for the site, you walk through a lit le setup in which
you identify your main grocery store and check o the foods your
family likes. Later, you can pick another nearby store if you want to
compare prices. Next, you’re presented with a list of items that
are based on your preferences and asked: “What are you in the mood
for this week?” Make your choices, select the number of meals
you’re ready to plan, and choose what you care about most</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	meals
you’re ready to plan, and choose what you care about most in terms
of time, money, health, or variety. At this point, the site searches
through recipes that match your needs, prices out the cost of the
meal for you, and lets you print out your shopping list.6</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Clearly,
this is an elaborate service. Behind the scenes, a team of
professional chefs devise recipes that take advantage of items that
are on sale at local grocery stores around the country. Those recipes
are matched via computer algorithm to each family’s unique needs
and preferences. Try to visualize the work involved: databases of
almost every grocery store in the country must be maintained,
including what’s on sale at each one this week. Those groceries
have to be matched to appropriate recipes and then appropriately
customized, tagged, and sorted. If a recipe cal s for broccoli rabe,
is that the same ingredient as the broccoli on sale at the local
market?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	After
reading that description, you might be surprised to learn that Food
on the Table (FotT) began life with a single customer.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead
of supporting thousands of grocery stores around the country as it
does today, FotT supported just one. How did the company choose which
store to support? The founders didn’t—until they had their rst
customer. Similarly, they began life with no recipes whatsoever—until
their rst customer was ready to begin her meal planning. In fact, the
company served its rst customer without building any software,
without signing any business development partnerships, and without
hiring any chefs.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Manuel,
along with VP of product Steve Sanderson, went to local supermarkets
and moms’ groups in his hometown of Austin. Part of their mission
was the typical observation of customers that is a part of design
thinking and other ideation techniques. However, Manuel and his team
were also on the hunt for something else: their rst customer.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
they met potential customers in those set ings, they would interview
them the way any good market researcher would, but at the end of each
interview they would at empt to make a sale.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They’d
describe the bene ts of FotT, name a weekly subscription fee, and
invite the customer to sign up. Most times they were rejected. After
al , most people are not early adopters and wil not</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	rejected.
After al , most people are not early adopters and wil not sign up for
a new service sight unseen. But eventual y someone did.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	That
one early adopter got the concierge treatment. Instead of interacting
with the FotT product via impersonal software, she got a personal
visit each week from the CEO of the company. He and the VP of product
would review what was on sale at her preferred grocery store and
careful y select recipes on the basis of her preferences, going so
far as to learn her favorite recipes for items she regularly cooked
for her family. Each week they would hand her—in person—a
prepared packet containing a shopping list and relevant recipes,
solicit her feedback, and make changes as necessary. Most important,
each week they would col ect a check for $9.95.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Talk
about ine cient! Measured according to traditional criteria, this is
a terrible system, entirely nonscalable and a complete waste of time.
The CEO and VP of product, instead of building their business, are
engaged in the drudgery of solving just one customer’s problem.
Instead of marketing themselves to mil ions, they sold themselves to
one. Worst of al , their e orts didn’t appear to be leading to
anything tangible. They had no product, no meaningful revenue, no
databases of recipes, not even a lasting organization.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
viewed through the lens of the Lean Startup, they were making
monumental progress. Each week they were learning more and more about
what was required to make their product a success.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	After
a few weeks they were ready for another customer. Each customer they
brought on made it easier to get the next one, because FotT could
focus on the same grocery store, get ing to know its products and the
kinds of people who shopped there wel .</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Each
new customer got the concierge treatment: personal in-home visits,
the works. But after a few more customers, the overhead of serving
them one-on-one started to increase.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Only
at the point where the founders were too busy to bring on additional
customers did Manuel and his team start to invest in automation in
the form of product development. Each iteration of their minimum
viable product al owed them to save a lit le more time and serve a
few more customers: delivering the recipes and shopping list via
e-mail instead of via an in-home visit, starting to</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	shopping
list via e-mail instead of via an in-home visit, starting to parse
lists of what was on sale automatical y via software instead of by
hand, even eventual y taking credit card payments online instead of a
handwrit en check.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Before
long, they had built a substantial service o ering, rst in the Austin
area and eventual y nationwide. But along the way, their product
development team was always focused on scaling something that was
working rather than trying to invent something that might work in the
future. As a result, their development e orts involved far less waste
than is typical for a venture of this kind.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
is important to contrast this with the case of a smal business, in
which it is routine to see the CEO, founder, president, and owner
serving customers directly, one at a time. In a concierge MVP, this
personalized service is not the product but a learning activity
designed to test the leap-of-faith assumptions in the company’s
growth model. In fact, a common outcome of a concierge MVP is to
invalidate the company’s proposed growth model, making it clear
that a di erent approach is needed. This can happen even if the
initial MVP is pro table for the company. Without a formal growth
model, many companies get caught in the trap of being satis ed with a
smal pro table business when a pivot (change in course or strategy)
might lead to more signi cant growth. The only way to know is to have
tested the growth model systematical y with real customers.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Meet
Max Ventil a and Damon Horowitz, technologists with a vision to build
a new type of search software designed to answer the kinds of
questions that befuddle state-of-the-art companies such as Google.
Google befuddled? Think about it. Google and its peers excel at
answering factual questions: What is the tal est mountain in the
world? Who was the twenty-third president of the United States? But
for more subjective questions, Google struggles. Ask,</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“What’s
a good place to go out for a drink after the bal game in my city?”
and the technology flails. What’s interesting about this class of
queries is that they are relatively easy for a person to answer.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Imagine
being at a cocktail party surrounded by friends. How likely would you
be to get a high-quality answer to your subjective question? You
almost certainly would get one. Unlike factual queries, because these
subjective questions have no single right answer, today’s
technology struggles to answer them. Such questions depend on the
person answering them, his or her personal experience, taste, and
assessment of what you’re looking for.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
solve this problem, Max and Damon created a product cal ed Aardvark.
With their deep technical knowledge and industry experience, it would
have been reasonable to expect them to dive in and start programming.
Instead, they took six months to gure out what they should be
building. But they didn’t spend that year at the whiteboard
strategizing or engage in a lengthy market research project.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead,
they built a series of functioning products, each designed to test a
way of solving this problem for their customers. Each product was
then o ered to beta testers, whose behavior was used to validate or
refute each speci c hypothesis (see examples in sidebar).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The

period.7</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Rekkit.

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Max
and Damon had a vision that computers could be used to create a
virtual personal assistant to which their customers could ask
questions. Because the assistant was designed for subjective
questions, the answers required human judgment. Thus, the early
Aardvark experiments tried many variations on this theme, building a
series of prototypes for ways customers could interact with the
virtual assistant and get their questions answered. Al the early
prototypes failed to engage the customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
Max describes it, “We self-funded the company and released very
cheap prototypes to test. What became Aardvark was the sixth
prototype. Each prototype was a two- to four-week e ort. We used
humans to replicate the back end as much as possible. We invited one
hundred to two hundred friends to try the prototypes and measured how
many of them came back. The results were unambiguously negative until
Aardvark.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Because
of the short time line, none of the prototypes involved advanced
technology. Instead, they were MVPs designed to test a more important
question: what would be required to get customers to engage with the
product and tel their friends about it?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Once
we chose Aardvark,” Ventil a says, “we continued to run</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Once
we chose Aardvark,” Ventil a says, “we continued to run with
humans replicating pieces of the backend for nine months. We hired
eight people to manage queries, classify conversations, etc.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
actual y raised our seed and series A rounds before the system was
automated—the assumption was that the lines between humans and arti
cial intel igence would cross, and we at least proved that we were
building stuf people would respond to.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“As
we re ned the product, we would bring in six to twelve people weekly
to react to mockups, prototypes, or simulations that we were working
on. It was a mix of existing users and people who never saw the
product before. We had our engineers join for many of these sessions,
both so that they could make modi cations in real time, but also so
we could al experience the pain of a user not knowing what to do.”8</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Aardvark product they set led on worked via instant messaging (IM).
Customers could send Aardvark a question via IM, and Aardvark would
get them an answer that was drawn from the customer’s social
network: the system would seek out the customer’s friends and
friends of friends and pose the question to them. Once it got a
suitable answer, it would report back to the initial customer.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Of
course, a product like that requires a very important algorithm:
given a question about a certain topic, who is the best person in the
customer’s social network to answer that question?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, a question about restaurants in San Francisco shouldn’t be
routed to someone in Seat le. More chal enging stil , a question
about computer programming probably shouldn’t be routed to an art
student.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Throughout
their testing process, Max and Damon encountered many di cult
technological problems like these. Each time, they emphatical y
refused to solve them at that early stage. Instead, they used Wizard
of Oz testing to fake it. In a Wizard of Oz test, customers believe
they are interacting with the actual product, but behind the scenes
human beings are doing the work. Like the concierge MVP, this
approach is incredibly ine cient. Imagine a service that al owed
customers to ask questions of human</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	service
that al owed customers to ask questions of human researchers—for
free—and expect a real-time response. Such a service (at scale)
would lose money, but it is easy to build on a micro scale. At that
scale, it al owed Max and Damon to answer these al -important
questions: If we can solve the tough technical problems behind this
arti cial intel igence product, wil people use it? Wil their use lead
to the creation of a product that has real value?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
was this system that al owed Max and Damon to pivot over and over
again, rejecting concepts that seemed promising but that would not
have been viable. When they were ready to start scaling, they had a
ready-made road map of what to build. The result: Aardvark was
acquired for a reported $50 mil ion—by Google.9</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	THE
ROLE OF QUALITY AND DESIGN IN AN MVP</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	One
of the most vexing aspects of the minimum viable product is the chal
enge it poses to traditional notions of quality. The best
professionals and craftspersons alike aspire to build quality
products; it is a point of pride.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Modern
production processes rely on high quality as a way to boost e ciency.
They operate using W. Edwards Deming’s famous dictum that the
customer is the most important part of the production process. This
means that we must focus our energies exclusively on producing
outcomes that the customer perceives as valuable. Al owing sloppy
work into our process inevitably leads to excessive variation.
Variation in process yields products of varying quality in the eyes
of the customer that at best require rework and at worst lead to a
lost customer. Most modern business and engineering philosophies
focus on producing high-quality experiences for customers as a
primary principle; it is the foundation of Six Sigma, lean
manufacturing, design thinking, extreme programming, and the software
craftsmanship movement.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
discussions of quality presuppose that the company already knows what
at ributes of the product the customer wil perceive as worthwhile. In
a startup, this is a risky assumption to make. Often</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	worthwhile.
In a startup, this is a risky assumption to make. Often we are not
even sure who the customer is. Thus, for startups, I believe in the
fol owing quality principle:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Even
a “low-quality” MVP can act in service of building a great
high-quality product. Yes, MVPs sometimes are perceived as
low-quality by customers. If so, we should use this as an opportunity
to learn what at ributes customers care about. This is in nitely bet
er than mere speculation or whiteboard strategizing, because it
provides a solid empirical foundation on which to build future
products.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Sometimes,
however, customers react quite di erently. Many famous products were
released in a “low-quality” state, and customers loved them.
Imagine if Craig Newmark, in the early days of Craigslist, had
refused to publish his humble e-mail newslet er because it lacked su
cient high design. What if the founders of Groupon had felt “two
pizzas for the price of one” was beneath them?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
have had many similar experiences. In the early days of IMVU, our
avatars were locked in one place, unable to move around the screen.
The reason? We were building an MVP and had not yet tackled the di
cult task of creating the technology that would al ow avatars to walk
around the virtual environments they inhabit.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
the video game industry, the standard is that 3D avatars should move
uidly as they walk, avoid obstacles in their path, and take an intel
igent route toward their destination. Famous best-sel ing games such
as Electronic Arts’ The Sims work on this principle. We didn’t
want to ship a low-quality version of this feature, so we opted
instead to ship with stationary avatars.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Feedback
from the customers was very consistent: they wanted the ability to
move their avatars around the environment. We took this as bad news
because it meant we would have to spend considerable amounts of time
and money on a high-quality solution similar to The Sims. But before
we commit ed ourselves to that</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	similar
to The Sims. But before we commit ed ourselves to that path, we
decided to try another MVP. We used a simple hack, which felt almost
like cheating. We changed the product so that customers could click
where they wanted their avatar to go, and the avatar would teleport
there instantly. No walking, no obstacle avoidance. The avatar
disappeared and then reappeared an instant later in the new place. We
couldn’t even a ord fancy teleportation graphics or sound e ects.
We felt lame shipping this feature, but it was al we could af ord.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	You
can imagine our surprise when we started to get positive customer
feedback. We never asked about the movement feature directly (we were
too embarrassed). But when asked to name the top things about IMVU
they liked best, customers consistently listed avatar “teleportation”
among the top three (unbelievably, they often speci cal y described
it as “more advanced than The Sims”).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
inexpensive compromise outperformed many features of the product we
were most proud of, features that had taken much more time and money
to produce.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Customers
don’t care how much time something takes to build.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
care only if it serves their needs. Our customers preferred the quick
teleportation feature because it al owed them to get where they
wanted to go as fast as possible. In retrospect, this makes sense.
Wouldn’t we al like to get wherever we’re going in an instant? No
lines, no hours on a plane or sit ing on the tarmac, no connections,
no cabs or subways. Beam me up, Scot y. Our expensive “real-world”
approach was beaten handily by a cool fantasy-world feature that cost
much less but that our customers preferred.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	So
which version of the product is low-quality, again?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	MVPs
require the courage to put one’s assumptions to the test. If
customers react the way we expect, we can take that as con rmation
that our assumptions are correct. If we release a poorly designed
product and customers (even early adopters) cannot gure out how to
use it, that wil con rm our need to invest in superior design. But we
must always ask: what if they don’t care about design in the same
way we do?</p>

We must be wil ing to set aside our traditional professional
standards to start the process of validated learning as soon as
possible. But once again, this does not mean operating in a sloppy or
undisciplined way. (This is an important caveat. There is a category
of quality problems that have the net e ect of slowing down the
Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Defects make it more di cult to
evolve the product. They actual y interfere with our ability to learn
and so are dangerous to tolerate in any production process. We wil
consider methods for guring out when to make investments in

remove any feature, process, or e ort that does not contribute
directly to the learning you seek.</p>

BUMPS IN BUILDING AN MVP</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Building
an MVP is not without risks, both real and imagined. Both can derail
a startup e ort unless they are understood ahead of time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
most common speed bumps are legal issues, fears about competitors,
branding risks, and the impact on morale.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
startups that rely on patent protection, there are special chal enges
with releasing an early product. In some jurisdictions, the window
for ling a patent begins when the product is released to the general
public, and depending on the way the MVP is structured, releasing it
may start this clock. Even if your startup is not in one of those
jurisdictions, you may want international patent protection and may
wind up having to abide by these more stringent requirements. (In my
opinion, issues like this are one of the many ways in which current
patent law inhibits innovation and should be remedied as a mat er of
public policy.) In many industries, patents are used primarily for
defensive purposes, as a deterrent to hold competitors at bay. In
such cases, the patent risks of an MVP are minor compared with the
learning bene ts. However, in industries in which a new scienti c</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	bene
ts. However, in industries in which a new scienti c breakthrough is
at the heart of a company’s competitive advantage, these risks need
to be balanced more careful y. In al cases, entrepreneurs should seek
legal counsel to ensure that they understand the risks ful y.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Legal
risks may be daunting, but you may be surprised to learn that the
most common objection I have heard over the years to building an MVP
is fear of competitors—especial y large established
companies—stealing a startup’s ideas. If only it were so easy to
have a good idea stolen! Part of the special chal enge of being a
startup is the near impossibility of having your idea, company, or
product be noticed by anyone, let alone a competitor. In fact, I have
often given entrepreneurs fearful of this issue the fol owing
assignment: take one of your ideas (one of your lesser insights,
perhaps), nd the name of the relevant product manager at an
established company who has responsibility for that area, and try to
get that company to steal your idea. Cal them up, write them a memo,
send them a press release—go ahead, try it. The truth is that most
managers in most companies are already overwhelmed with good ideas.
Their chal enge lies in prioritization and execution, and it is those
chal enges that give a startup hope of surviving.10</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
a competitor can outexecute a startup once the idea is known, the
startup is doomed anyway. The reason to build a new team to pursue an
idea is that you believe you can accelerate through the
Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop faster than anyone else can. If
that’s true, it makes no di erence what the competition knows. If
it’s not true, a startup has much bigger problems, and secrecy
won’t x them. Sooner or later, a successful startup wil face
competition from fast fol owers. A head start is rarely large enough
to mat er, and time spent in stealth mode—away from customers—is
unlikely to provide a head start. The only way to win is to learn
faster than anyone else.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Many
startups plan to invest in building a great brand, and an MVP can
seem like a dangerous branding risk. Similarly, entrepreneurs in
existing organizations often are constrained by the fear of damaging
the parent company’s established brand. In either</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	fear
of damaging the parent company’s established brand. In either of
these cases, there is an easy solution: launch the MVP under a di
erent brand name. In addition, a long-term reputation is only at risk
when companies engage in vocal launch activities such as PR</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	and
building hype. When a product fails to live up to those
pronouncements, real long-term damage can happen to a corporate
brand. But startups have the advantage of being obscure, having a
pathetical y smal number of customers, and not having much exposure.
Rather than lamenting them, use these advantages to experiment under
the radar and then do a public marketing launch once the product has
proved itself with real customers.11</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Final
y, it helps to prepare for the fact that MVPs often result in bad
news. Unlike traditional concept tests or prototypes, they are
designed to speak to the ful range of business questions, not just
design or technical ones, and they often provide a needed dose of
reality. In fact, piercing the reality distortion eld is quite
uncomfortable. Visionaries are especial y afraid of a false negative:
that customers wil reject a awed MVP that is too smal or too limited.
It is precisely this at itude that one sees when companies launch ful
y formed products without prior testing. They simply couldn’t bear
to test them in anything less than their ful splendor.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Yet
there is wisdom in the visionary’s fear. Teams steeped in
traditional product development methods are trained to make go/kil
decisions on a regular basis. That is the essence of the waterfal or
stage-gate development model. If an MVP fails, teams are liable to
give up hope and abandon the project altogether. But this is a
solvable problem.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	FROM
THE MVP TO INNOVATION ACCOUNTING</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
solution to this dilemma is a commitment to iteration. You have to
commit to a locked-in agreement—ahead of time—that no mat er what
comes of testing the MVP, you wil not give up hope.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Successful

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	—after
many iterations—you may learn that some element of your product or
strategy is awed and decide it is time to make a change, which I cal
a pivot, to a di erent method for achieving your vision.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Startups
are especial y at risk when outside stakeholders and investors
(especial y corporate CFOs for internal projects) have a crisis of
con dence. When the project was authorized or the investment made,
the entrepreneur promised that the new product would be
world-changing. Customers were supposed to ock to it in record
numbers. Why are so few actual y doing so?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
traditional management, a manager who promises to deliver something
and fails to do so is in trouble. There are only two possible
explanations: a failure of execution or a failure to plan
appropriately. Both are equal y inexcusable. Entrepreneurial managers
face a di cult problem: because the plans and projections we make are
ful of uncertainty, how can we claim success when we inevitably fail
to deliver what we promised? Put another way, how does the CFO or VC
know that we’re failing because we learned something critical and
not because we were goofing of or misguided?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
solution to this problem resides at the heart of the Lean Startup
model. We al need a disciplined, systematic approach to guring out if
we’re making progress and discovering if we’re actual y achieving
validated learning. I cal this system innovation accounting, an
alternative to traditional accounting designed specifical y for
startups. It is the subject of Chapter 7.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	7MEASURE</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	At
the beginning, a startup is litle more than a model on a piece of
paper. The nancials in the business plan include projections of how
many customers the company expects to at ract, how much it wil spend,
and how much revenue and pro t that wil lead to. It’s an ideal
that’s usual y far from where the startup is in its early days.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
startup’s job is to (1) rigorously measure where it is right now,
confronting the hard truths that assessment reveals, and then (2)
devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to
the ideal reflected in the business plan.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
products—even the ones that fail—do not have zero traction. Most
products have some customers, some growth, and some positive results.
One of the most dangerous outcomes for a startup is to bumble along
in the land of the living dead. Employees and entrepreneurs tend to
be optimistic by nature. We want to keep believing in our ideas even
when the writing is on the wal . This is why the myth of perseverance
is so dangerous. We al know stories of epic entrepreneurs who managed
to pul out a victory when things seemed incredibly bleak.
Unfortunately, we don’t hear stories about the countless nameless
others who persevered too long, leading their companies to failure.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	People
are accustomed to thinking of accounting as dry and boring, a
necessary evil used primarily to prepare nancial reports and survive
audits, but that is because accounting is something that has become
taken for granted. Historical y, under the leadership of people such
as Alfred Sloan at General Motors, accounting became an essential
part of the method of exerting centralized control over far- ung
divisions. Accounting al owed GM to set clear milestones for each of
its divisions and then hold each manager accountable for his or her
division’s success in reaching those goals. Al modern corporations
use some variation of that approach. Accounting is the key to their
success.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
standard accounting is not helpful in evaluating entrepreneurs.
Startups are too unpredictable for forecasts and milestones to be
accurate.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
recently met with a phenomenal startup team. They are wel nanced,
have signi cant customer traction, and are growing rapidly. Their
product is a leader in an emerging category of enterprise software
that uses consumer marketing techniques to sel into large companies.
For example, they rely on employee-to-employee viral adoption rather
than a traditional sales process, which might target the chief
information o cer or the head of information technology (IT). As a
result, they have the opportunity to use cut ing-edge experimental
techniques as they constantly revise their product. During the
meeting, I asked the team a simple question that I make a habit of
asking startups whenever we meet: are you making your product bet er?
They always say yes. Then I ask: how do you know? I invariably get
this answer: wel , we are in engineering and we made a number of
changes last month, and our customers seem to like them, and our
overal numbers are higher this month. We must be on the right track.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is the kind of storytel ing that takes place at most startup board
meetings. Most milestones are built the same way: hit a certain
product milestone, maybe talk to a few customers, and see if the

a startup is making progress. How do we know that the changes we’ve

important, how do we know that we are drawing the right lessons from

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
answer these kinds of questions, startups have a strong need for a
new kind of accounting geared speci cal y to disruptive innovation.
That’s what innovation accounting is.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	An
Accountability Framework That Works Across Industries Innovation
accounting enables startups to prove objectively that they are
learning how to grow a sustainable business. Innovation accounting
begins by turning the leap-of-faith assumptions discussed i n Chapter
5 into a quantitative nancial model. Every business plan has some
kind of model associated with it, even if it’s writ en on the back
of a napkin. That model provides assumptions about what the business
wil look like at a successful point in the future.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, the business plan for an established manufacturing company
would show it growing in proportion to its sales volume.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
the pro ts from the sales of goods are reinvested in marketing and
promotions, the company gains new customers. The rate of growth
depends primarily on three things: the pro tability of each customer,
the cost of acquiring new customers, and the repeat purchase rate of
existing customers. The higher these values are, the faster the
company wil grow and the more pro table it wil be.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
are the drivers of the company’s growth model.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	By
contrast, a marketplace company that matches buyers and sel ers such
as eBay wil have a di erent growth model. Its success depends
primarily on the network e ects that make it the premier destination
for both buyers and sel ers to transact business. Sel ers want the
marketplace with the highest number of potential customers. Buyers
want the marketplace with the most competition among sel ers, which
leads to the greatest availability of products and the lowest prices.
(In economics, this sometimes is cal ed supply-side increasing
returns and demand-side increasing returns.) For this kind of
startup, the important thing to measure is that the network e ects
are working, as evidenced by the high retention rate</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	network
e ects are working, as evidenced by the high retention rate of new
buyers and sel ers. If people stick with the product with very lit le
at rition, the marketplace wil grow no mat er how the company
acquires new customers. The growth curve wil look like a compounding
interest table, with the rate of growth depending on the “interest
rate” of new customers coming to the product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Though
these two businesses have very di erent drivers of growth, we can
stil use a common framework to hold their leaders accountable. This
framework supports accountability even when the model changes.</p>

INNOVATION ACCOUNTING WORKS—THREE LEARNING</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>MILESTONES</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Innovation
accounting works in three steps: rst, use a minimum viable product to
establish real data on where the company is right now. Without a
clear-eyed picture of your current status—no mat er how far from
the goal you may be—you cannot begin to track your progress.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Second,
startups must at empt to tune the engine from the baseline toward the
ideal. This may take many at empts. After the startup has made al the
micro changes and product optimizations it can to move its baseline
toward the ideal, the company reaches a decision point. That is the
third step: pivot or persevere.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
the company is making good progress toward the ideal, that means it’s
learning appropriately and using that learning ef ectively, in which
case it makes sense to continue. If not, the management team eventual
y must conclude that its current product strategy is awed and needs a
serious change. When a company pivots, it starts the process al over
again, reestablishing a new baseline and then tuning the engine from
there. The sign of a successful pivot is that these engine-tuning
activities are more productive after the pivot than before.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Establish
the Baseline</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, a startup might create a complete prototype of its product
and o er to sel it to real customers through its main marketing
channel. This single MVP would test most of the startup’s
assumptions and establish baseline metrics for each assumption
simultaneously. Alternatively, a startup might prefer to build
separate MVPs that are aimed at get ing feedback on one assumption at
a time. Before building the prototype, the company might perform a
smoke test with its marketing materials. This is an old direct
marketing technique in which customers are given the opportunity to
preorder a product that has not yet been built. A smoke test measures
only one thing: whether customers are interested in trying a product.
By itself, this is insu cient to validate an entire growth model.
Nonetheless, it can be very useful to get feedback on this assumption
before commit ing more money and other resources to the product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
MVPs provide the first example of a learning milestone. An MVP al ows
a startup to l in real baseline data in its growth model—conversion
rates, sign-up and trial rates, customer lifetime value, and so
on—and this is valuable as the foundation for learning about
customers and their reactions to a product even if that foundation
begins with extremely bad news.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
one is choosing among the many assumptions in a business plan, it
makes sense to test the riskiest assumptions first. If you can’t nd
a way to mitigate these risks toward the ideal that is required for a
sustainable business, there is no point in testing the others. For
example, a media business that is sel ing advertising has two basic
assumptions that take the form of questions: Can it capture the at
ention of a de ned customer segment on an ongoing basis? and can it
sel that at ention to advertisers? In a business in which the
advertising rates for a particular customer segment are wel known,
the far riskier assumption is the ability to capture at ention.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Therefore,
the rst experiments should involve content production rather than
advertising sales. Perhaps the company wil produce a pilot episode or
issue to see how customers engage.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Tuning
the Engine</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Once
the baseline has been established, the startup can work toward the
second learning milestone: tuning the engine. Every product
development, marketing, or other initiative that a startup undertakes
should be targeted at improving one of the drivers of its growth
model. For example, a company might spend time improving the design
of its product to make it easier for new customers to use. This
presupposes that the activation rate of new customers is a driver of
growth and that its baseline is lower than the company would like. To
demonstrate validated learning, the design changes must improve the
activation rate of new customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
they do not, the new design should be judged a failure. This is an
important rule: a good design is one that changes customer behavior
for the bet er.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Compare
two startups. The rst company sets out with a clear baseline metric,
a hypothesis about what wil improve that metric, and a set of
experiments designed to test that hypothesis. The second team sits
around debating what would improve the product, implements several of
those changes at once, and celebrates if there is any positive
increase in any of the numbers. Which startup is more likely to be
doing e ective work and achieving lasting results?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Pivot
or Persevere</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Over
time, a team that is learning its way toward a sustainable business
wil see the numbers in its model rise from the horrible baseline
established by the MVP and converge to something like the ideal one
established in the business plan. A startup that fails to do so wil
see that ideal recede ever farther into the distance. When this is
done right, even the most powerful reality distortion eld won’t be
able to cover up this simple fact: if we’re not moving the drivers
of our business model, we’re not making progress. That becomes a
sure sign that it’s time to pivot.</p>

ACCOUNTING AT IMVU</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Here’s
what innovation accounting looked like for us in the early days of
IMVU. Our minimum viable product had many defects and, when we rst
released it, extremely low sales. We natural y assumed that the lack
of sales was related to the low quality of the product, so week after
week we worked on improving the quality of the product, trusting that
our e orts were worthwhile. At the end of each month, we would have a
board meeting at which we would present the results. The night before
the board meeting, we’d run our standard analytics, measuring
conversion rates, customer counts, and revenue to show what a good
job we had done. For several meetings in a row, this caused a
last-minute panic because the quality improvements were not yielding
any change in customer behavior. This led to some frustrating board
meetings at which we could show great product “progress” but not
much in the way of business results. After a while, rather than leave
it to the last minute, we began to track our metrics more frequently,
tightening the feedback loop with product development. This was even
more depressing. Week in, week out, our product changes were having
no ef ect.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Improving
a Product on Five Dol ars a Day</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
tracked the “funnel metrics” behaviors that were critical to our
engine of growth: customer registration, the download of our
application, trial, repeat usage, and purchase. To have enough data
to learn, we needed just enough customers using our product to get
real numbers for each behavior. We al ocated a budget of ve dol ars
per day: enough to buy clicks on the then-new Google AdWords system.
In those days, the minimum you could bid for a click was 5 cents, but
there was no overal minimum to your spending. Thus, we could a ord to
open an account and get started even though we had very lit le
money.1</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	even
though we had very lit le money.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Five
dol ars bought us a hundred clicks—every day. From a marketing
point of view this was not very signi cant, but for learning it was
priceless. Every single day we were able to measure our product’s
performance with a brand new set of customers. Also, each time we
revised the product, we got a brand new report card on how we were
doing the very next day.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, one day we would debut a new marketing message aimed at
rst-time customers. The next day we might change the way new
customers were initiated into the product. Other days, we would add
new features, x bugs, rol out a new visual design, or try a new
layout for our website. Every time, we told ourselves we were making
the product bet er, but that subjective con dence was put to the acid
test of real numbers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Day
in and day out we were performing random trials. Each day was a new
experiment. Each day’s customers were independent of those of the
day before. Most important, even though our gross numbers were
growing, it became clear that our funnel metrics were not changing.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This

Analysis</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
read the graph, you need to understand something cal ed cohort
analysis. This is one of the most important tools of startup
analytics.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Although
it sounds complex, it is based on a simple premise.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Although
it sounds complex, it is based on a simple premise.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead
of looking at cumulative totals or gross numbers such as total
revenue and total number of customers, one looks at the performance
of each group of customers that comes into contact with the product
independently. Each group is cal ed a cohort. The graph shows the
conversion rates to IMVU of new customers who joined in each
indicated month. Each conversion rate shows the percentage of
customer who registered in that month who subsequently went on to
take the indicated action. Thus, among al the customers who joined
IMVU in February 2005, about 60</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	percent
of them logged in to our product at least one time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Managers
with an enterprise sales background wil recognize this funnel
analysis as the traditional sales funnel that is used to manage
prospects on their way to becoming customers. Lean Startups use it in
product development, too. This technique is useful in many types of
business, because every company depends for its survival on sequences
of customer behavior cal ed ows. Customer ows govern the interaction
of customers with a company’s products.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
al ow us to understand a business quantitatively and have much more
predictive power than do traditional gross metrics.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
you look closely, you’l see that the graph shows some clear trends.
Some product improvements are helping—a lit le. The percentage of
new customers who go on to use the product at least ve times has
grown from less than 5 percent to almost 20 percent.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Yet
despite this fourfold increase, the percentage of new customers who
pay money for IMVU is stuck at around 1 percent. Think about that for
a moment. After months and months of work, thousands of individual
improvements, focus groups, design sessions, and usability tests, the
percentage of new customers who subsequently pay money is exactly the
same as it was at the onset even though many more customers are get
ing a chance to try the product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Thanks
to the power of cohort analysis, we could not blame this failure on
the legacy of previous customers who were resistant to change,
external market conditions, or any other excuse. Each cohort
represented an independent report card, and try as we might, we were
get ing straight C’s. This helped us realize we had a</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	might,
we were get ing straight C’s. This helped us realize we had a
problem.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
was in charge of the product development team, smal though it was in
those days, and shared with my cofounders the sense that the problem
had to be with my team’s e orts. I worked harder, tried to focus on
higher- and higher-quality features, and lost a lot of sleep.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Our
frustration grew. When I could think of nothing else to do, I was nal
y ready to turn to the last resort: talking to customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Armed
with our failure to make progress tuning our engine of growth, I was
ready to ask the right questions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Before
this failure, in the company’s earliest days, it was easy to talk
to potential customers and come away convinced we were on the right
track. In fact, when we would invite customers into the o ce for
in-person interviews and usability tests, it was easy to dismiss
negative feedback. If they didn’t want to use the product, I
assumed they were not in our target market. “Fire that customer,”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I’d
say to the person responsible for recruiting for our tests. “Find
me someone in our target demographic.” If the next customer was
more positive, I would take it as confirmation that I was right in my
targeting. If not, I’d fire another customer and try again.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	By
contrast, once I had data in hand, my interactions with customers
changed. Suddenly I had urgent questions that needed answering: Why
aren’t customers responding to our product</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“improvements”?
Why isn’t our hard work paying o ? For example, we kept making it
easier and easier for customers to use IMVU with their existing
friends. Unfortunately, customers didn’t want to engage in that
behavior. Making it easier to use was total y beside the point. Once
we knew what to look for, genuine understanding came much faster. As
was described in Chapter 3, this eventual y led to a critical y
important pivot: away from an IM</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	add-on
used with existing friends and toward a stand-alone network one can
use to make new friends. Suddenly, our worries about productivity
vanished. Once our e orts were aligned with what customers real y
wanted, our experiments were much more likely to change their
behavior for the bet er.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
pat ern would repeat time and again, from the days when we were
making less than a thousand dol ars in revenue per month</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	we
were making less than a thousand dol ars in revenue per month al the
way up to the time we were making mil ions. In fact, this is the sign
of a successful pivot: the new experiments you run are overal more
productive than the experiments you were running before.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is the pat ern: poor quantitative results force us to declare failure
and create the motivation, context, and space for more qualitative
research. These investigations produce new ideas—new hypotheses—to
be tested, leading to a possible pivot. Each pivot unlocks new
opportunities for further experimentation, and the cycle repeats.
Each time we repeat this simple rhythm: establish the baseline, tune
the engine, and make a decision to pivot or persevere.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>OPTIMIZATION
VERSUS LEARNING</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Engineers,
designers, and marketers are al skil ed at optimization.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, direct marketers are experienced at split testing value
propositions by sending a di erent o er to two similar groups of
customers so that they can measure di erences in the response rates
of the two groups. Engineers, of course, are skil ed at improving a
product’s performance, just as designers are talented at making
products easier to use. Al these activities in a wel -run traditional
organization o er incremental bene t for incremental e ort. As long
as we are executing the plan wel , hard work yields results.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
these tools for product improvement do not work the same way for
startups. If you are building the wrong thing, optimizing the product
or its marketing wil not yield signi cant results. A startup has to
measure progress against a high bar: evidence that a sustainable
business can be built around its products or services. That’s a
standard that can be assessed only if a startup has made clear,
tangible predictions ahead of time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
the absence of those predictions, product and strategy decisions are
far more di cult and time-consuming. I often see this in my
consulting practice. I’ve been cal ed in many times to help a
startup that feels that its engineering team “isn’t working hard
enough.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	that
feels that its engineering team “isn’t working hard enough.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
I meet with those teams, there are always improvements to be made and
I recommend them, but invariably the real problem is not a lack of
development talent, energy, or e ort. Cycle after cycle, the team is
working hard, but the business is not seeing results.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Managers
trained in a traditional model draw the logical conclusion: our team
is not working hard, not working e ectively, or not working ef
iciently.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Thus
the downward cycle begins: the product development team valiantly
tries to build a product according to the speci cations it is
receiving from the creative or business leadership. When good results
are not forthcoming, business leaders assume that any discrepancy
between what was planned and what was built is the cause and try to
specify the next iteration in greater detail. As the speci cations
get more detailed, the planning process slows down, batch size
increases, and feedback is delayed. If a board of directors or CFO is
involved as a stakeholder, it doesn’t take long for personnel
changes to fol ow.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
few years ago, a team that sel s products to large media companies
invited me to help them as a consultant because they were concerned
that their engineers were not working hard enough.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
the fault was not in the engineers; it was in the process the whole
company was using to make decisions. They had customers but did not
know them very wel . They were deluged with feature requests from
customers, the internal sales team, and the business leadership.
Every new insight became an emergency that had to be addressed
immediately. As a result, long-term projects were hampered by
constant interruptions. Even worse, the team had no clear sense of
whether any of the changes they were making mat ered to customers.
Despite the constant tuning and tweaking, the business results were
consistently mediocre.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Learning
milestones prevent this negative spiral by emphasizing a more likely
possibility: the company is executing—with discipline!</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	—a
plan that does not make sense. The innovation accounting framework
makes it clear when the company is stuck and needs to change
direction.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
the example above, early in the company’s life, the product
development team was incredibly productive because the company’s
founders had identi ed a large unmet need in the target market. The
initial product, while awed, was popular with early adopters. Adding
the major features that customers asked for seemed to work wonders,
as the early adopters spread the word about the innovation far and
wide. But unasked and unanswered were other lurking questions: Did
the company have a working engine of growth? Was this early success
related to the daily work of the product development team? In most
cases, the answer was no; success was driven by decisions the team
had made in the past.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	None
of its current initiatives were having any impact. But this was
obscured because the company’s gross metrics were al “up and to
the right.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
we’l see in a moment, this is a common danger. Companies of any
size that have a working engine of growth can come to rely on the
wrong kind of metrics to guide their actions. This is what tempts
managers to resort to the usual bag of success theater tricks:
last-minute ad buys, channel stu ng, and whiz-bang demos, in a
desperate at empt to make the gross numbers look bet er. Energy
invested in success theater is energy that could have been used to
help build a sustainable business. I cal the traditional numbers used
to judge startups “vanity metrics,” and innovation accounting
requires us to avoid the temptation to use them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	VANITY
METRICS: A WORD OF CAUTION</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
see the danger of vanity metrics clearly, let’s return once more to
the early days of IMVU. Take a look at the fol owing graph, which is
from the same era in IMVU’s history as that shown earlier in this
chapter. It covers the same time period as the cohort-style graph on
this page; in fact, it is from the same board presentation.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
graph shows the traditional gross metrics for IMVU so far: total
registered users and total paying customers (the gross revenue graph
looks almost the same). From this viewpoint, things look much more
exciting. That’s why I cal these vanity metrics: they give</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	much
more exciting. That’s why I cal these vanity metrics: they give the
rosiest possible picture. You’l see a traditional hockey stick
graph (the ideal in a rapid-growth company). As long as you focus on
the top-line numbers (signing up more customers, an increase in
overal revenue), you’l be forgiven for thinking this product
development team is making great progress. The company’s growth
engine is working. Each month it is able to acquire customers and has
a positive return on investment. The excess revenue from those
customers is reinvested the next month in acquiring more. That’s
where the growth is coming from.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	But
think back to the same data presented in a cohort style.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	IMVU
is adding new customers, but it is not improving the yield on each
new group. The engine is turning, but the e orts to tune the</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	each
new group. The engine is turning, but the e orts to tune the engine
are not bearing much fruit. From the traditional graph alone, you
cannot tel whether IMVU is on pace to build a sustainable business;
you certainly can’t tel anything about the ef icacy of the
entrepreneurial team behind it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Innovation
accounting wil not work if a startup is being misled by these kinds
of vanity metrics: gross number of customers and so on. The
alternative is the kind of metrics we use to judge our business and
our learning milestones, what I cal actionable metrics.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>ACTIONABLE
METRICS VERSUS VANITY METRICS</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
get a bet er sense of the importance of good metrics, let’s look at
a company cal ed Grockit. Its founder, Farbood Nivi, spent a decade
working as a teacher at two large for-pro t education companies,
Princeton Review and Kaplan, helping students prepare for
standardized tests such as the GMAT, LSAT, and SAT. His engaging
classroom style won accolades from his students and promotions from
his superiors; he was honored with Princeton Review’s National
Teacher of the Year award. But Farb was frustrated with the
traditional teaching methods used by those companies. Teaching six to
nine hours per day to thousands of students, he had many
opportunities to experiment with new approaches.2</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Over
time, Farb concluded that the traditional lecture model of education,
with its one-to-many instructional approach, was inadequate for his
students. He set out to develop a superior approach, using a
combination of teacher-led lectures, individual homework, and group
study. In particular, Farb was fascinated by how e ective the
student-to-student peer-driven learning method was for his students.
When students could help each other, they bene ted in two ways.
First, they could get customized instruction from a peer who was much
less intimidating than a teacher.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Second,
they could reinforce their learning by teaching it to others.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Over
time, Farb’s classes became increasingly social—and successful.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
this unfolded, Farb felt more and more that his physical presence in
the classroom was less important. He made an</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	presence
in the classroom was less important. He made an important connection:
“I have this social learning model in my classroom. There’s al
this social stu going on on the web.” His idea was to bring social
peer-to-peer learning to people who could not a ord an expensive
class from Kaplan or Princeton Review or an even more expensive
private tutor. From this insight Grockit was born.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Farb
explains, “Whether you’re studying for the SAT or you’re
studying for algebra, you study in one of three ways. You spend some
time with experts, you spend some time on your own, and you spend
some time with your peers. Grockit o ers these three same formats of
studying. What we do is we apply technology and algorithms to
optimize those three forms.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Farb
is the classic entrepreneurial visionary. He recounts his original
insight this way: “Let’s forget educational design up until now,
let’s forget what’s possible and just redesign learning with
today’s students and today’s technology in mind. There were
plenty of multi-bil ion-dol ar organizations in the education space,
and I don’t think they were innovating in the way that we needed
them to and I didn’t think we needed them anymore. To me, it’s
real y al about the students and I didn’t feel like the students
were being served as wel as they could.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Today
Grockit o ers many di erent educational products, but in the
beginning Farb fol owed a lean approach. Grockit built a minimum
viable product, which was simply Farb teaching test prep via the
popular online web conferencing tool WebEx. He built no custom
software, no new technology. He simply at empted to bring his new
teaching approach to students via the Internet. News about a new kind
of private tutoring spread quickly, and within a few months Farb was
making a decent living teaching online, with monthly revenues of
$10,000 to $15,000. But like many entrepreneurs with ambition, Farb
didn’t build his MVP just to make a living. He had a vision of a
more col aborative, more e ective kind of teaching for students
everywhere. With his initial traction, he was able to raise money
from some of the most prestigious investors in Silicon Val ey.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
I rst met Farb, his company was already on the fast track</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
I rst met Farb, his company was already on the fast track to success.
They had raised venture capital from wel -regarded investors, had
built an awesome team, and were fresh o an impressive debut at one of
Silicon Val ey’s famous startup competitions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
were extremely process-oriented and disciplined. Their product
development fol owed a rigorous version of the agile development
methodology known as Extreme Programming (described below), thanks to
their partnership with a San Francisco–based company cal ed Pivotal
Labs. Their early product was hailed by the press as a breakthrough.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
was only one problem: they were not seeing su cient growth in the use
of the product by customers. Grockit is an excel ent case study
because its problems were not a mat er of failure of execution or
discipline.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Fol
owing standard agile practice, Grockit’s work proceeded in a series
of sprints, or one-month iteration cycles. For each sprint, Farb
would prioritize the work to be done that month by writing a series
of user stories, a technique taken from agile development. Instead of
writing a speci cation for a new feature that described it in
technical terms, Farb would write a story that described the feature
from the point of view of the customer. That story helped keep the
engineers focused on the customer’s perspective throughout the
development process.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Each
feature was expressed in plain language in terms everyone could
understand whether they had a technical background or not.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Again
fol owing standard agile practice, Farb was free to reprioritize
these stories at any time. As he learned more about what customers
wanted, he could move things around in the product backlog, the queue
of stories yet to be built. The only limit on this ability to change
directions was that he could not interrupt any task that was in
progress. Fortunately, the stories were writ en in such a way that
the batch size of work (which I’l discuss in more detail in Chapter
9) was only a day or two.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
system is cal ed agile development for a good reason: teams that
employ it are able to change direction quickly, stay light on their
feet, and be highly responsive to changes in the business</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	their
feet, and be highly responsive to changes in the business
requirements of the product owner (the manager of the process—in
this case Farb—who is responsible for prioritizing the stories).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	How
did the team feel at the end of each sprint? They consistently
delivered new product features. They would col ect feedback from
customers in the form of anecdotes and interviews that indicated that
at least some customers liked the new features.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
was always a certain amount of data that showed improvement: perhaps
the total number of customers was increasing, the total number of
questions answered by students was going up, or the number of
returning customers was increasing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
I sensed that Farb and his team were left with lingering doubts about
the company’s overal progress. Was the increase in their numbers
actual y caused by their development e orts? Or could it be due to
other factors, such as mentions of Grockit in the press? When I met
the team, I asked them this simple question: How do you know that the
prioritization decisions that Farb is making actual y make sense?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Their
answer: “That’s not our department. Farb makes the decisions; we
execute them.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	At
that time Grockit was focused on just one customer segment:
prospective business school students who were studying for the GMAT.
The product al owed students to engage in online study sessions with
fel ow students who were studying for the same exam.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
product was working: the students who completed their studying via
Grockit achieved signi cantly higher scores than they had before. But
the Grockit team was struggling with the age-old startup problems:
How do we know which features to prioritize?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	How
can we get more customers to sign up and pay? How can we get out the
word about our product?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
put this question to Farb: “How con dent are you that you are
making the right decisions in terms of establishing priorities?”
Like most startup founders, he was looking at the available data and
making the best educated guesses he could. But this left a lot of
room for ambiguity and doubt.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Farb
believed in his vision thoroughly and completely, yet he was starting
to question whether his company was on pace to realize</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	starting
to question whether his company was on pace to realize that vision.
The product improved every day, but Farb wanted to make sure those
improvements mat ered to customers. I believe he deserves a lot of
credit for realizing this. Unlike many visionaries, who cling to
their original vision no mat er what, Farb was wil ing to put his
vision to the test.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Farb
worked hard to sustain his team’s belief that Grockit was destined
for success. He was worried that morale would su er if anyone thought
that the person steering the ship was uncertain about which direction
to go. Farb himself wasn’t sure if his team would embrace a true
learning culture. After al , this was part of the grand bargain of
agile development: engineers agree to adapt the product to the
business’s constantly changing requirements but are not responsible
for the quality of those business decisions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Agile
is an e cient system of development from the point of view of the
developers. It al ows them to stay focused on creating features and
technical designs. An at empt to introduce the need to learn into
that process could undermine productivity.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	(Lean
manufacturing faced similar problems when it was introduced in
factories. Managers were used to focusing on the utilization rate of
each machine. Factories were designed to keep machines running at ful
capacity as much of the time as possible.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Viewed
from the perspective of the machine, that is e cient, but from the
point of view of the productivity of the entire factory, it is wildly
ine cient at times. As they say in systems theory, that which
optimizes one part of the system necessarily undermines the system as

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
Farb and his team didn’t realize was that Grockit’s progress was
being measured by vanity metrics: the total number of customers and
the total number of questions answered. That was what was causing his
team to spin its wheels; those metrics gave the team the sensation of
forward motion even though the company was making lit le progress.
What’s interesting is how closely Farb’s method fol owed super
cial aspects of the Lean Startup learning milestones: they shipped an
early product and established some baseline metrics. They had
relatively short iterations, each of which was judged by its ability
to improve customer metrics.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	was
judged by its ability to improve customer metrics.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
because Grockit was using the wrong kinds of metrics, the startup was
not genuinely improving. Farb was frustrated in his e orts to learn
from customer feedback. In every cycle, the type of metrics his team
was focused on would change: one month they would look at gross usage
numbers, another month registration numbers, and so on. Those metrics
would go up and down seemingly on their own. He couldn’t draw clear
cause-and-e ect inferences. Prioritizing work correctly in such an
environment is extremely chal enging.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Farb
could have asked his data analyst to investigate a particular
question. For example, when we shipped feature X, did it a ect
customer behavior? But that would have required tremendous time and e
ort. When, exactly, did feature X ship? Which customers were exposed
to it? Was anything else launched around that same time? Were there
seasonal factors that might be skewing the data?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Finding
these answers would have required parsing reams and reams of data.
The answer often would come weeks after the question had been asked.
In the meantime, the team would have moved on to new priorities and
new questions that needed urgent at ention.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Compared
to a lot of startups, the Grockit team had a huge advantage: they
were tremendously disciplined. A disciplined team may apply the wrong
methodology but can shift gears quickly once it discovers its error.
Most important, a disciplined team can experiment with its own
working style and draw meaningful conclusions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Cohorts
and Split-tests</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Grockit
changed the metrics they used to evaluate success in two ways.
Instead of looking at gross metrics, Grockit switched to cohort-based
metrics, and instead of looking for cause-and-e ect relationships
after the fact, Grockit would launch each new feature as a true
split-test experiment.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
split-test experiment is one in which di erent versions of a product
are o ered to customers at the same time. By observing the changes in
behavior between the two groups, one can make inferences about the
impact of the di erent variations. This technique was pioneered by
direct mail advertisers. For example, consider a company that sends
customers a catalog of products to buy, such as Lands’ End or Crate
&amp; Barrel. If you wanted to test a catalog design, you could send
a new version of it to 50 percent of the customers and send the old
standard catalog to the other 50</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	percent.
To assure a scienti c result, both catalogs would contain identical
products; the only di erence would be the changes to the design. To
gure out if the new design was e ective, al you would have to do was
keep track of the sales gures for both groups of customers. (This
technique is sometimes cal ed A/B testing after the practice of
assigning let er names to each variation.) Although split testing
often is thought of as a marketing-speci c (or even a direct
marketing–speci c) practice, Lean Startups incorporate it directly
into product development.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
changes led to an immediate change in Farb’s understanding of the
business. Split testing often uncovers surprising things. For
example, many features that make the product bet er in the eyes of
engineers and designers have no impact on customer behavior. This was
the case at Grockit, as it has been in every company I have seen
adopt this technique. Although working with split tests seems to be
more di cult because it requires extra accounting and metrics to keep
track of each variation, it almost always saves tremendous amounts of
time in the long run by eliminating work that doesn’t mat er to
customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Split
testing also helps teams re ne their understanding of what customers
want and don’t want. Grockit’s team constantly added new ways for
their customers to interact with each other in the hope that those
social communication tools would increase the product’s value.
Inherent in those e orts was the belief that customers desired more
communication during their studying.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
split testing revealed that the extra features did not change
customer behavior, it cal ed that belief into question.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
questioning inspired the team to seek a deeper understanding of what
customers real y wanted. They brainstormed new ideas for product
experiments that might have more impact. In fact, many of these ideas
were not new. They had simply been overlooked because the company was
focused on building social tools. As a result, Grockit tested an
intensive solo-studying mode, complete with quests and gamelike
levels, so that students could have the choice of studying by
themselves or with others. Just as in Farb’s original classroom,
this proved extremely e ective. Without the discipline of split
testing, the company might not have had this realization. In fact,
over time, through dozens of tests, it became clear that the key to
student engagement was to o er them a combination of social and solo
features. Students preferred having a choice of how to study.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Kanban</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Fol
owing the lean manufacturing principle of kanban, or capacity
constraint, Grockit changed the product prioritization process.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Under
the new system, user stories were not considered complete until they
led to validated learning. Thus, stories could be cataloged as being
in one of four states of development: in the product backlog,
actively being built, done (feature complete from a technical point
of view), or in the process of being validated.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Validated
was de ned as “knowing whether the story was a good idea to have
been done in the rst place.” This validation usual y would come in
the form of a split test showing a change in customer behavior but
also might include customer interviews or surveys.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
kanban rule permit ed only so many stories in each of the four
states. As stories ow from one state to the other, the buckets l up.
Once a bucket becomes ful , it cannot accept more stories.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Only
when a story has been validated can it be removed from the kanban
board. If the validation fails and it turns out the story is a bad
idea, the relevant feature is removed from the product (see the chart
on this page).</p>

have implemented this system with several teams, and the initial
result is always frustrating: each bucket l s up, starting with the
“validated” bucket and moving on to the “done” bucket, until
it’s not possible to start any more work. Teams that are used to
measuring their productivity narrowly, by the number of stories they
are delivering, feel stuck. The only way to start work on new
features is to investigate some of the stories that are done but
haven’t been validated. That often requires nonengineering e orts:
talking to customers, looking at split-test data, and the like.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Pret
y soon everyone gets the hang of it. This progress occurs in ts and
starts at rst. Engineering may nish a big batch of work, fol owed by
extensive testing and validation. As engineers look for ways to
increase their productivity, they start to realize that if they
include the validation exercise from the beginning, the whole team
can be more productive.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, why build a new feature that is not part of a split-test
experiment? It may save you time in the short run, but it wil take
more time later to test, during the validation phase. The same logic
applies to a story that an engineer doesn’t understand. Under the
old system, he or she would just build it and nd out later what it
was for. In the new system, that behavior is clearly
counterproductive: without a clear hypothesis, how can a story ever
be validated? We saw this behavior at IMVU, too. I once saw a junior
engineer face down a senior executive over a relatively minor change.
The engineer insisted that the new feature be split-tested, just like
any other. His peers backed him up; it was considered absolutely
obvious that al features should be routinely tested, no mat er who
was commissioning them. (Embarrassingly, al too often I was the
executive in question.) A solid process lays the foundation for a
healthy culture, one where ideas are evaluated by merit and not by
job title.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
important, teams working in this system begin to measure their
productivity according to validated learning, not in terms of the
production of new features.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Hypothesis
Testing at Grockit</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
Grockit made this transition, the results were dramatic. In one case,
they decided to test one of their major features, cal ed lazy
registration, to see if it was worth the heavy investment they were
making in ongoing support. They were con dent in this feature because
lazy registration is considered one of the design best practices for
online services. In this system, customers do not have to register
for the service up front. Instead, they immediately begin using the
service and are asked to register only after they have had a chance
to experience the service’s benefit.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
a student, lazy registration works like this: when you come to the
Grockit website, you’re immediately placed in a study session with
other students working on the same test. You don’t have to give
your name, e-mail address, or credit card number. There is nothing to
prevent you from jumping in and get ing started immediately. For
Grockit, this was essential to testing one of its core assumptions:
that customers would be wil ing to adopt this new way of learning
only if they could see proof that it was working early on.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
a result of this hypothesis, Grockit’s design required that it
manage three classes of users: unregistered guests, registered
(trial) guests, and customers who had paid for the premium version of
the product. This design required signi cant extra work to build and
maintain: the more classes of users there are, the more work is
required to keep track of them, and the more marketing e ort is
required to create the right incentives to entice customers to
upgrade to the next class. Grockit had undertaken this extra e ort
because lazy registration was considered an industry best practice.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
encouraged the team to try a simple split-test. They took one cohort
of customers and required that they register immediately, based on
nothing more than Grockit’s marketing materials. To their surprise,
this cohort’s behavior was exactly the same as that of the lazy
registration group: they had the same rate of registration,
activation, and subsequent retention. In other words, the extra e ort
of lazy registration was a complete waste even though it was
considered an industry best practice.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	considered
an industry best practice.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Even
more important than reducing waste was the insight that this test
suggested: customers were basing their decision about Grockit on
something other than their use of the product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Think
about this. Think about the cohort of customers who were required to
register for the product before entering a study session with other
students. They had very lit le information about the product, nothing
more than was presented on Grockit’s home page and registration
page. By contrast, the lazy registration group had a tremendous
amount of information about the product because they had used it. Yet
despite this information disparity, customer behavior was exactly the
same.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
suggested that improving Grockit’s positioning and marketing might
have a more signi cant impact on at racting new customers than would
adding new features. This was just the rst of many important
experiments Grockit was able to run. Since those early days, they
have expanded their customer base dramatical y: they now o er test
prep for numerous standardized tests, including the GMAT, SAT, ACT,
and GRE, as wel as online math and English courses for students in
grades 7 through 12.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Grockit
continues to evolve its process, seeking continuous improvement at
every turn. With more than twenty employees in its San Francisco o
ce, Grockit continues to operate with the same deliberate,
disciplined approach that has been their hal mark al along. They have
helped close to a mil ion students and are sure to help mil ions
more.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	THE
VALUE OF THE THREE A’S</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
examples from Grockit demonstrate each of the three A’s of metrics:
actionable, accessible, and auditable.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Actionable</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
a report to be considered actionable, it must demonstrate clear</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
a report to be considered actionable, it must demonstrate clear cause
and e ect. Otherwise, it is a vanity metric. The reports that
Grockit’s team began to use to judge their learning milestones made
it extremely clear what actions would be necessary to replicate the
results.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	By
contrast, vanity metrics fail this criterion. Take the number of hits
to a company website. Let’s say we have 40,000 hits this month</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	—a
new record. What do we need to do to get more hits? Wel , that
depends. Where are the new hits coming from? Is it from 40,000</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	new
customers or from one guy with an extremely active web browser? Are
the hits the result of a new marketing campaign or PR</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	push?
What is a hit, anyway? Does each page in the browser count as one
hit, or do al the embedded images and multimedia content count as wel
? Those who have sat in a meeting debating the units of measurement
in a report wil recognize this problem.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Vanity
metrics wreak havoc because they prey on a weakness of the human
mind. In my experience, when the numbers go up, people think the
improvement was caused by their actions, by whatever they were
working on at the time. That is why it’s so common to have a
meeting in which marketing thinks the numbers went up because of a
new PR or marketing e ort and engineering thinks the bet er numbers
are the result of the new features it added. Finding out what is
actual y going on is extremely costly, and so most managers simply
move on, doing the best they can to form their own judgment on the
basis of their experience and the col ective intel igence in the
room.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
when the numbers go down, it results in a very di erent reaction: now
it’s somebody else’s fault. Thus, most team members or
departments live in a world where their department is constantly
making things bet er, only to have their hard work sabotaged by other
departments that just don’t get it. Is it any wonder these
departments develop their own distinct language, jargon, culture, and
defense mechanisms against the bozos working down the hal ?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Actionable
metrics are the antidote to this problem. When cause and e ect is
clearly understood, people are bet er able to learn from their
actions. Human beings are innately talented learners</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	from

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Accessible</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Al
too many reports are not understood by the employees and managers who
are supposed to use them to guide their decision making.
Unfortunately, most managers do not respond to this complexity by
working hand in hand with the data warehousing team to simplify the
reports so that they can understand them bet er. Departments too
often spend their energy learning how to use data to get what they
want rather than as genuine feedback to guide their future actions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
is an antidote to this misuse of data. First, make the reports as
simple as possible so that everyone understands them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Remember
the saying “Metrics are people, too.” The easiest way to make
reports comprehensible is to use tangible, concrete units.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
is a website hit? Nobody is real y sure, but everyone knows what a
person visiting the website is: one can practical y picture those
people sit ing at their computers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is why cohort-based reports are the gold standard of learning
metrics: they turn complex actions into people-based reports. Each
cohort analysis says: among the people who used our product in this
period, here’s how many of them exhibited each of the behaviors we
care about. In the IMVU example, we saw four behaviors: downloading
the product, logging into the product from one’s computer, engaging
in a chat with other customers, and upgrading to the paid version of
the product. In other words, the report deals with people and their
actions, which are far more useful than piles of data points. For
example, think about how hard it would have been to tel if IMVU was
being successful if we had reported only on the total number of
person-to-person conversations. Let’s say we have 10,000
conversations in a period. Is that good? Is that one person being
very, very social, or is it 10,000</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	people
each trying the product one time and then giving up?</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
the gross numbers get larger, accessibility becomes more and more
important. It is hard to visualize what it means if the number of
website hits goes down from 250,000 in one month to 200,000</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	the

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Accessibility
also refers to widespread access to the reports.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Grockit
did this especial y wel . Every day their system automatical y
generated a document containing the latest data for every single one
of their split-test experiments and other leap-of-faith metrics. This
document was mailed to every employee of the company: they al always
had a fresh copy in their e-mail in-boxes.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
reports were wel laid out and easy to read, with each experiment and
its results explained in plain English.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Another
way to make reports accessible is to use a technique we developed at
IMVU. Instead of housing the analytics or data in a separate system,
our reporting data and its infrastructure were considered part of the
product itself and were owned by the product development team. The
reports were available on our website, accessible to anyone with an
employee account.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Each
employee could log in to the system at any time, choose from a list
of al current and past experiments, and see a simple one-page summary
of the results. Over time, those one-page summaries became the de
facto standard for set ling product arguments throughout the
organization. When people needed evidence to support something they
had learned, they would bring a printout with them to the relevant
meeting, con dent that everyone they showed it to would understand
its meaning.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Auditable</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
informed that their pet project is a failure, most of us are tempted
to blame the messenger, the data, the manager, the gods, or anything
else we can think of. That’s why the third A of good metrics,

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	metrics,
“auditable,” is so essential. We must ensure that the data is
credible to employees.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
employees at IMVU would brandish one-page reports to demonstrate what
they had learned to set le arguments, but the process often wasn’t
so smooth. Most of the time, when a manager, developer, or team was
confronted with results that would kil a pet project, the loser of
the argument would chal enge the veracity of the data.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Such
chal enges are more common than most managers would admit, and
unfortunately, most data reporting systems are not designed to answer
them successful y. Sometimes this is the result of a wel -intentioned
but misplaced desire to protect the privacy of customers. More often,
the lack of such supporting documentation is simply a mat er of
neglect. Most data reporting systems are not built by product
development teams, whose job is to prioritize and build product
features. They are built by business managers and analysts. Managers
who must use these systems can only check to see if the reports are
mutual y consistent. They al too often lack a way to test if the data
is consistent with reality.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
solution? First, remember that “Metrics are people, too.” We need
to be able to test the data by hand, in the messy real world, by
talking to customers. This is the only way to be able to check if the
reports contain true facts. Managers need the ability to spot check
the data with real customers. It also has a second bene t: systems
that provide this level of auditability give managers and
entrepreneurs the opportunity to gain insights into why customers are
behaving the way the data indicate.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Second,
those building reports must make sure the mechanisms that generate
the reports are not too complex. Whenever possible, reports should be
drawn directly from the master data, rather than from an intermediate
system, which reduces opportunities for error.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
have noticed that every time a team has one of its judgments or
assumptions overturned as a result of a technical problem with the
data, its confidence, morale, and discipline are undermined.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
we watch entrepreneurs succeed in the mythmaking world of Hol ywood,
books, and magazines, the story is always structured the same way.
First, we see the plucky protagonist having an epiphany, hatching a
great new idea. We learn about his or her character and personality,
how he or she came to be in the right place at the right time, and
how he or she took the dramatic leap to start a business.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Then
the photo montage begins. It’s usual y short, just a few minutes of
time-lapse photography or narrative. We see the protagonist building
a team, maybe working in a lab, writing on whiteboards, closing
sales, pounding on a few keyboards. At the end of the montage, the
founders are successful, and the story can move on to more
interesting fare: how to split the spoils of their success, who wil
appear on magazine covers, who sues whom, and implications for the
future.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
the real work that determines the success of startups happens during
the photo montage. It doesn’t make the cut in terms of the big
story because it is too boring. Only 5 percent of entrepreneurship is
the big idea, the business model, the whiteboard strategizing, and
the split ing up of the spoils. The other 95 percent is the grit y
work that is measured by innovation accounting: product
prioritization decisions, deciding which customers to target or
listen to, and having the courage to subject a grand vision to
constant testing and feedback.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	One
decision stands out above al others as the most di cult, the most
time-consuming, and the biggest source of waste for most startups. We
al must face this fundamental test: deciding when to pivot and when
to persevere. To understand what happens during the photo montage, we
have to understand how to pivot, and that is the subject of Chapter
8.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	8PIVOT
(OR PERSEVERE)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Every
entrepreneur eventual y faces an overriding chal enge in developing a
successful product: deciding when to pivot and when to persevere.
Everything that has been discussed so far is a prelude to a seemingly
simple question: are we making su cient progress to believe that our
original strategic hypothesis is correct, or do we need to make a
major change? That change is cal ed a pivot: a structured course
correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the
product, strategy, and engine of growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Because
of the scienti c methodology that underlies the Lean Startup, there
is often a misconception that it o ers a rigid clinical formula for
making pivot or persevere decisions. This is not true.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
is no way to remove the human element—vision, intuition,
judgment—from the practice of entrepreneurship, nor would that be
desirable.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	My
goal in advocating a scienti c approach to the creation of startups
is to channel human creativity into its most productive form, and
there is no bigger destroyer of creative potential than the misguided
decision to persevere. Companies that cannot bring themselves to
pivot to a new direction on the basis of feedback from the
marketplace can get stuck in the land of the living dead, neither
growing enough nor dying, consuming resources and commitment from
employees and other stakeholders but not moving ahead.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
is good news about our reliance on judgment, though. We</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
is good news about our reliance on judgment, though. We are able to
learn, we are innately creative, and we have a remarkable ability to
see the signal in the noise. In fact, we are so good at this that
sometimes we see signals that aren’t there. The heart of the
scienti c method is the realization that although human judgment may
be faulty, we can improve our judgment by subjecting our theories to
repeated testing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Startup
productivity is not about cranking out more widgets or features. It
is about aligning our e orts with a business and product that are
working to create value and drive growth. In other words, successful
pivots put us on a path toward growing a sustainable business.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	INNOVATION
ACCOUNTING LEADS TO FASTER PIVOTS</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
see this process in action, meet David Binet i, the CEO of Votizen.
David has had a long career helping to bring the American political
process into the twenty- rst century. In the early 1990s, he helped
build USA.gov, the rst portal for the federal government.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	He’s
also experienced some classic startup failures. When it came time to
build Votizen, David was determined to avoid bet ing the farm on his
vision.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David
wanted to tackle the problem of civic participation in the political
process. His rst product concept was a social network of veri ed
voters, a place where people passionate about civic causes could get
together, share ideas, and recruit their friends. David built his
first minimum viable product for just over $1,200 in about three
months and launched it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David
wasn’t building something that nobody wanted. In fact, from its
earliest days, Votizen was able to at ract early adopters who loved
the core concept. Like al entrepreneurs, David had to re ne his
product and business model. What made David’s chal enge especial y
hard was that he had to make those pivots in the face of moderate
success.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David’s
initial concept involved four big leaps of faith:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
Customers would be interested enough in the social network to sign
up. (Registration)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
Votizen would be able to verify them as registered voters.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	(Activation)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
Customers who were veri ed voters would engage with the site’s
activism tools over time. (Retention) 4. Engaged customers would tel
their friends about the service and recruit them into civic causes.
(Referral) Three months and $1,200 later, David’s rst MVP was in
customers’ hands. In the initial cohorts, 5 percent signed up for
the service and 17 percent veri ed their registered voter status (see
the chart below). The numbers were so low that there wasn’t enough
data to tel what sort of engagement or referral would occur. It was
time to start iterating.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David
spent the next two months and another $5,000 split testing new
product features, messaging, and improving the product’s design to
make it easier to use. Those tests showed dramatic improvements,
going from a 5 percent registration rate to 17</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	percent

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Such
is the power of split testing. This optimization gave David a
critical mass of customers with which to measure the next two leaps
of faith. However, as shown in the chart below, those numbers proved
to be even more discouraging: David achieved a referral rate of only
4 percent and a retention rate of 5 percent.</p>

knew he had to do more development and testing. For the next three
months he continued to optimize, split test, and re ne his pitch. He
talked to customers, held focus groups, and did countless A/B
experiments. As was explained in Chapter 7, in a split test, di erent
versions of a product are o ered to di erent customers at the same
time. By observing the changes in behavior between the two groups,
one can make inferences about the impact of the di erent variations.
As shown in the chart below, the referral rate nudged up slightly to
6 percent and the retention rate went up to 8 percent. A disappointed
David had spent eight months and $20,000 to build a product that

faced the di cult chal enge of deciding whether to pivot or
persevere. This is one of the hardest decisions entrepreneurs face.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
goal of creating learning milestones is not to make the decision</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
goal of creating learning milestones is not to make the decision
easy; it is to make sure that there is relevant data in the room when
it comes time to decide.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Remember,
at this point David has had many customer conversations. He has
plenty of learning that he can use to rationalize the failure he has
experienced with the current product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	That’s
exactly what many entrepreneurs do. In Silicon Val ey, we cal this
experience get ing stuck in the land of the living dead. It happens
when a company has achieved a modicum of success—just enough to
stay alive—but is not living up to the expectations of its founders
and investors. Such companies are a terrible drain of human energy.
Out of loyalty, the employees and founders don’t want to give in;
they feel that success might be just around the corner.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David
had two advantages that helped him avoid this fate: 1. Despite being
commit ed to a signi cant vision, he had done his best to launch
early and iterate. Thus, he was facing a pivot or persevere moment
just eight months into the life of his company. The more money, time,
and creative energy that has been sunk into an idea, the harder it is
to pivot. David had done wel to avoid that trap.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
David had identi ed his leap-of-faith questions explicitly at the
outset and, more important, had made quantitative predictions about
each of them. It would not have been di cult for him to declare
success retroactively from that initial venture. After al , some of
his metrics, such as activation, were doing quite wel .</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
terms of gross metrics such as total usage, the company had positive
growth. It is only because David focused on actionable metrics for
each of his leap-of-faith questions that he was able t o accept that
his company was failing. In addition, because David had not wasted
energy on premature PR, he was able to make this determination
without public embarrassment or distraction.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Failure
is a prerequisite to learning. The problem with the notion of
shipping a product and then seeing what happens is that you are</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	of
shipping a product and then seeing what happens is that you are
guaranteed to succeed—at seeing what happens. But then what? As
soon as you have a handful of customers, you’re likely to have ve
opinions about what to do next. Which should you listen to?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Votizen’s
results were okay, but they were not good enough.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David
felt that although his optimization was improving the metrics, they
were not trending toward a model that would sustain the business
overal . But like al good entrepreneurs, he did not give up
prematurely. David decided to pivot and test a new hypothesis. A
pivot requires that we keep one foot rooted in what we’ve learned
so far, while making a fundamental change in strategy in order to
seek even greater validated learning. In this case, David’s direct
contact with customers proved essential.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	He
had heard three recurring bits of feedback in his testing: 1. “I
always wanted to get more involved; this makes it so much easier.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
“The fact that you prove I’m a voter mat ers.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
“There’s no one here. What’s the point of coming back?”1</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David
decided to undertake what I cal a zoom-in pivot, refocusing the
product on what previously had been considered just one feature of a
larger whole. Think of the customer comments above: customers like
the concept, they like the voter registration technology, but they
aren’t get ing value out of the social networking part of the
product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David
decided to change Votizen into a product cal ed @2gov, a</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“social
lobbying platform.” Rather than get customers integrated in a civic
social network, @2gov al ows them to contact their elected
representatives quickly and easily via existing social networks such
as Twit er. The customer engages digital y, but @2gov translates that
digital contact into paper form. Members of Congress receive
old-fashioned printed let ers and petitions as a result. In other
words, @2gov translates the high-tech world of its customers into the
low-tech world of politics.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	@2gov

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	@2gov
had a slightly di erent set of leap-of-faith questions to answer. It
stil depended on customers signing up, verifying their voter status,
and referring their friends, but the growth model changed. Instead of
relying on an engagement-driven business (“sticky” growth), @2gov
was more transactional. David’s hypothesis was that passionate
activists would be wil ing to pay money to have @2gov facilitate
contacts on behalf of voters who cared about their issues.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David’s
new MVP took four months and another $30,000. He’d now spent a
grand total of $50,000 and worked for twelve months.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	But
the results from his next round of testing were dramatic:
registration rate 42 percent, activation 83 percent, retention 21</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	percent,
and referral a whopping 54 percent. However, the number of activists
wil ing to pay was less than 1 percent. The value of each transaction
was far too low to sustain a pro table business even after David had
done his best to optimize it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Before
we get to David’s next pivot, notice how convincingly he was able
to demonstrate validated learning. He hoped that with this new
product, he would be able to improve his leap-of-faith metrics
dramatical y, and he did (see the chart below).</p>

did this not by working harder but by working smarter, taking his
product development resources and applying them to a new and di erent
product. Compared with the previous four months of optimization, the
new four months of pivoting had resulted in a dramatical y higher
return on investment, but David was stil stuck in an age-old
entrepreneurial trap. His metrics and product were improving, but not
fast enough.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David
pivoted again. This time, rather than rely on activists to pay money
to drive contacts, he went to large organizations, professional
fund-raisers, and big companies, which al have a professional or
business interest in political campaigning. The companies seemed
extremely eager to use and pay for David’s service, and David
quickly signed let ers of intent to build the functionality they
needed. In this pivot, David did what I cal a customer segment pivot,
keeping the functionality of the product the same but changing the
audience focus. He focused on who pays: from consumers to businesses
and nonpro t organizations. In other words, David went from being a
business-to-consumer (B2C) company to being a business-to-business
(B2B) company. In the process he changed his planned growth model, as
wel to one where he would be able to fund growth out of the pro ts
generated from each B2B sale.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Three
months later, David had built the functionality he had promised,
based on those early let ers of intent. But when he went back to
companies to col ect his checks, he discovered more problems. Company
after company procrastinated, delayed, and ultimately passed up the
opportunity. Although they had been excited enough to sign a let er
of intent, closing a real sale was much more di cult. It turned out
that those companies were not early adopters.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	On
the basis of the let ers of intent, David had increased his head
count, taking on additional sales sta and engineers in anticipation
of having to service higher-margin business-to-business accounts.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
the sales didn’t materialize, the whole team had to work harder to
try to nd revenue elsewhere. Yet no mat er how many sales cal s they
went on and no mat er how much optimization they did to the product,
the model wasn’t working. Returning to his</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	did
to the product, the model wasn’t working. Returning to his
leap-of-faith questions, David concluded that the results refuted his
business-to-business hypothesis, and so he decided to pivot once
again.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Al
this time, David was learning and gaining feedback from his potential
customers, but he was in an unsustainable situation. You can’t pay
sta with what you’ve learned, and raising money at that juncture
would have escalated the problem. Raising money without early
traction is not a certain thing. If he had been able to raise money,
he could have kept the company going but would have been pouring
money into a value-destroying engine of growth. He would be in a
high-pressure situation: use investor’s cash to make the engine of
growth work or risk having to shut down the company (or be replaced).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David
decided to reduce sta and pivot again, this time at empting what I
cal a platform pivot. Instead of sel ing an application to one
customer at a time, David envisioned a new growth model inspired by
Google’s AdWords platform. He built a self-serve sales platform
where anyone could become a customer with just a credit card. Thus,
no mat er what cause you were passionate about, you could go to
@2gov’s website and @2gov would help you nd new people to get
involved. As always, the new people were veri ed registered voters,
and so their opinions carried weight with elected of icials.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
new product took only one additional month to build and immediately
showed results: 51 percent sign-up rate, 92 percent activation rate,
28 percent retention rate, 64 percent referral rate (see the chart
below). Most important, 11 percent of these customers were wil ing to
pay 20 cents per message. Most important, this was the beginning of
an actual growth model that could work. Receiving 20 cents per
message might not sound like much, but the high referral rate meant
that @2gov could grow its tra c without spending signi cant marketing
money (this is the viral engine of growth).</p>

story exhibits some common pat erns. One of the most important to
note is the acceleration of MVPs. The rst MVP took eight months, the
next four months, then three, then one. Each time David was able to
validate or refute his next hypothesis faster than before.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	How
can one explain this acceleration? It is tempting to credit it to the
product development work that had been going on. Many features had
been created, and with them a fair amount of infrastructure.
Therefore, each time the company pivoted, it didn’t have to start
from scratch. But this is not the whole story. For one thing, much of
the product had to be discarded between pivots.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Worse,
the product that remained was classified as a legacy product, one
that was no longer suited to the goals of the company. As is usual y
the case, the e ort required to reform a legacy product took extra
work. Counteracting these forces were the hard-won lessons David had
learned through each milestone. Votizen accelerated its MVP process
because it was learning critical things about its customers, market,
and strategy.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	David
Binet i sums up his experience building a Lean Startup: In 2003 I
started a company in roughly the same space as I’m in today. I had
roughly the same domain expertise and industry credibility, fresh o
the USA.gov success. But back then my company was a total failure
(despite consuming signi cantly greater investment), while now I have
a business making money and closing deals. Back then I did the
traditional linear product development model, releasing an amazing
product (it real y was) after 12 months of development, only to nd
that no one would buy it. This time I produced four versions in
twelve weeks and generated my rst sale relatively soon after that.
And it isn’t just market timing—two other companies that launched
in a similar space in 2003 subsequently sold for tens of mil ions of
dol ars, and others in 2010 fol owed a linear model straight to the
dead pool.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
STARTUP’S RUNWAY IS THE NUMBER OF PIVOTS IT CAN</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>STILL
MAKE</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Seasoned
entrepreneurs often speak of the runway that their startup has left:
the amount of time remaining in which a startup must either achieve
lift-o or fail. This usual y is de ned as the remaining cash in the
bank divided by the monthly burn rate, or net drain on that account
balance. For example, a startup with $1</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	mil
ion in the bank that is spending $100,000 per month has a projected
runway of ten months.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	projected
runway of ten months.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
startups start to run low on cash, they can extend the runway two
ways: by cut ing costs or by raising additional funds.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	But
when entrepreneurs cut costs indiscriminately, they are as liable to
cut the costs that are al owing the company to get through its
Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop as they are to cut waste. If the
cuts result in a slowdown to this feedback loop, al they have
accomplished is to help the startup go out of business more slowly.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
true measure of runway is how many pivots a startup has left: the
number of opportunities it has to make a fundamental change to its
business strategy. Measuring runway through the lens of pivots rather
than that of time suggests another way to extend that runway: get to
each pivot faster. In other words, the startup has to nd ways to
achieve the same amount of validated learning at lower cost or in a
shorter time. Al the techniques in the Lean Startup model that have
been discussed so far have this as their overarching goal.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>PIVOTS
REQUIRE COURAGE</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Ask
most entrepreneurs who have decided to pivot and they wil tel you
that they wish they had made the decision sooner. I believe there are
three reasons why this happens.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	First,
vanity metrics can al ow entrepreneurs to form false conclusions and
live in their own private reality. This is particularly damaging to
the decision to pivot because it robs teams of the belief that it is
necessary to change. When people are forced to change against their
bet er judgment, the process is harder, takes longer, and leads to a
less decisive outcome.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Second,
when an entrepreneur has an unclear hypothesis, it’s almost
impossible to experience complete failure, and without failure there
is usual y no impetus to embark on the radical change a pivot
requires. As I mentioned earlier, the failure of the “launch it and
see what happens” approach should now be evident: you wil always
succeed—in seeing what happens. Except in rare cases, the early
results wil be ambiguous, and you won’t know whether to</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	early
results wil be ambiguous, and you won’t know whether to pivot or
persevere, whether to change direction or stay the course.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Third,
many entrepreneurs are afraid. Acknowledging failure can lead to
dangerously low morale. Most entrepreneurs’ biggest fear is not
that their vision wil prove to be wrong. More terrifying is the
thought that the vision might be deemed wrong without having been
given a real chance to prove itself. This fear drives much of the
resistance to the minimum viable product, split testing, and other
techniques to test hypotheses. Ironical y, this fear drives up the
risk because testing doesn’t occur until the vision is ful y
represented. However, by that time it is often too late to pivot
because funding is running out. To avoid this fate, entrepreneurs
need to face their fears and be wil ing to fail, often in a public
way.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
fact, entrepreneurs who have a high pro le, either because of
personal fame or because they are operating as part of a famous
brand, face an extreme version of this problem.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
new startup in Silicon Val ey cal ed Path was started by experienced
entrepreneurs: Dave Morin, who previously had overseen Facebook’s
platform initiative; Dustin Mierau, product designer and cocreator of
Macster; and Shawn Fanning of Napster fame. They decided to release a
minimum viable product in 2010.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Because
of the high-pro le nature of its founders, the MVP at racted signi
cant press at ention, especial y from technology and startup blogs.
Unfortunately, their product was not targeted at technology early
adopters, and as a result, the early blogger reaction was quite
negative. (Many entrepreneurs fail to launch because they are afraid
of this kind of reaction, worrying that it wil harm the morale of the
entire company. The al ure of positive press, especial y in our</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“home”
industry, is quite strong.)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Luckily,
the Path team had the courage to ignore this fear and focus on what
their customers said. As a result, they were able to get essential
early feedback from actual customers. Path’s goal is to create a
more personal social network that maintains its quality over time.
Many people have had the experience of being overconnected on
existing social networks, sharing with past coworkers, high school
friends, relatives, and col eagues. Such broad groups make it hard to
share intimate moments. Path took an</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	groups
make it hard to share intimate moments. Path took an unusual
approach. For example, it limited the number of connections to fty,
based on brain research by the anthropologist Robin Dunbar at Oxford.
His research suggests that fty is roughly the number of personal
relationships in any person’s life at any given time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
members of the tech press (and many tech early adopters) this “arti
cial” constraint on the number of connections was anathema. They
routinely use new social networking products with thousands of
connections. Fifty seemed way too smal . As a result, Path endured a
lot of public criticism, which was hard to ignore.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	But
customers ocked to the platform, and their feedback was decidedly di
erent from the negativity in the press. Customers liked the intimate
moments and consistently wanted features that were not on the
original product road map, such as the ability to share how friends’
pictures made them feel and the ability to share “video moments.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Dave
Morin summed up his experience this way: The reality of our team and
our backgrounds built up a massive wal of expectations. I don’t
think it would have mat ered what we would have released; we would
have been met with expectations that are hard to live up to. But to
us it just meant we needed to get our product and our vision out into
the market broadly in order to get feedback and to begin iteration.
We humbly test our theories and our approach to see what the market
thinks. Listen to feedback honestly. And continue to innovate in the
directions we think wil create meaning in the world.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Path’s
story is just beginning, but already their courage in facing down
critics is paying o . If and when they need to pivot, they won’t be
hampered by fear. They recently raised $8.5 mil ion in venture
capital in a round led by Kleiner Perkins Cau eld &amp; Byers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
doing so, Path reportedly turned down an acquisition o er for $100
mil ion from Google.2</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	THE
PIVOT OR PERSEVERE MEETING</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
decision to pivot requires a clear-eyed and objective mind-set.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We’ve
discussed the tel tale signs of the need to pivot: the decreasing e
ectiveness of product experiments and the general feeling that
product development should be more productive.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Whenever
you see those symptoms, consider a pivot.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
decision to pivot is emotional y charged for any startup and has to
be addressed in a structured way. One way to mitigate this chal enge
is to schedule the meeting in advance. I recommend that every startup
have a regular “pivot or persevere” meeting. In my experience,
less than a few weeks between meetings is too often and more than a
few months is too infrequent. However, each startup needs to find its
own pace.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Each
pivot or persevere meeting requires the participation of both the
product development and business leadership teams. At IMVU, we also
added the perspectives of outside advisers who could help us see past
our preconceptions and interpret data in new ways. The product
development team must bring a complete report of the results of its
product optimization e orts over time (not just the past period) as
wel as a comparison of how those results stack up against
expectations (again, over time). The business leadership should bring
detailed accounts of their conversations with current and potential
customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Let’s
take a look at this process in action in a dramatic pivot done by a
company cal ed Wealthfront. That company was founded in 2007 by Dan
Carrol and added Andy Rachle as CEO shortly thereafter. Andy is a wel
-known gure in Silicon Val ey: he is a cofounder and former general
partner of the venture capital rm Benchmark Capital and is on the
faculty of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he teaches
a variety of courses on technology entrepreneurship. I</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	rst
met Andy when he</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	commissioned
a case study on IMVU to teach his students about the process we had
used to build the company.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Wealthfront’s
mission is to disrupt the mutual fund industry by bringing greater
transparency, access, and value to retail investors.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	bringing
greater transparency, access, and value to retail investors.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
makes Wealthfront’s story unusual, however, is not where it is
today but how it began: as an online game.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
Wealthfront’s original incarnation it was cal ed kaChing and was
conceived as a kind of fantasy league for amateur investors. It al
owed anyone to open a virtual trading account and build a portfolio
that was based on real market data without having to invest real
money. The idea was to identify diamonds in the rough: amateur
traders who lacked the resources to become fund managers but who
possessed market insight. Wealthfront’s founders did not want to be
in the online gaming business per se; kaChing was part of a
sophisticated strategy in the service of their larger vision. Any
student of disruptive innovation would have looked on approvingly:
they were fol owing that system perfectly by initial y serving
customers who were unable to participate in the mainstream market.
Over time, they believed, the product would become more and more
sophisticated, eventual y al owing users to serve (and disrupt)
existing professional fund managers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
identify the best amateur trading savants, Wealthfront built
sophisticated technology to rate the skil of each fund manager, using
techniques employed by the most sophisticated evaluators of money
managers, the premier U.S. university endowments. Those methods al
owed them to evaluate not just the returns the managers generated but
also the amount of risk they had taken along with how consistent they
performed relative to their declared investment strategy. Thus, fund
managers who achieved great returns through reckless gambles (i.e.,
investments outside their area of expertise) would be ranked lower
than those who had figured out how to beat the market through skil .</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	With
its kaChing game, Wealthfront hoped to test two leap-of-faith
assumptions:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
A signi cant percentage of the game players would demonstrate enough
talent as virtual fund managers to prove themselves suitable to
become managers of real assets (the value hypothesis).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	value
hypothesis).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
The game would grow using the viral engine of growth and generate
value using a freemium business model. The game was free to play, but
the team hoped that a percentage of the players would realize that
they were lousy traders and therefore want to convert to paying
customers once Wealthfront started o ering real asset management
services (the growth hypothesis).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	kaChing
was a huge early success, at racting more than 450,000</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	gamers
in its initial launch. By now, you should be suspicious of this kind
of vanity metric. Many less disciplined companies would have
celebrated that success and felt their future was secure, but
Wealthfront had identi ed its assumptions clearly and was able to
think more rigorously. By the time Wealthfront was ready to launch
its paid nancial product, only seven amateur managers had quali ed as
worthy of managing other people’s money, far less than the ideal
model had anticipated. After the paid product launched, they were
able to measure the conversion rate of gamers into paying customers.
Here too the numbers were discouraging: the conversion rate was close
to zero. Their model had predicted that hundreds of customers would
sign up, but only fourteen did.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
team worked valiantly to nd ways to improve the product, but none
showed any particular promise. It was time for a pivot or persevere
meeting.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
the data we have discussed so far was al that was available at that
critical meeting, Wealthfront would have been in trouble. They would
have known that their current strategy wasn’t working but not what
to do to x it. That is why it was critical that they fol owed the
recommendation earlier in this chapter to investigate alternative
possibilities. In this case, Wealthfront had pursued two important
lines of inquiry.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
rst was a series of conversations with professional money managers,
beginning with John Powers, the head of Stanford University’s
endowment, who reacted surprisingly positively.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Wealthfront’s
strategy was premised on the assumption that professional money
managers would be reluctant to join the system</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	professional
money managers would be reluctant to join the system because the
increased transparency would threaten their sense of authority.
Powers had no such concerns. CEO Andy Rachle then began a series of
conversations with other professional investment managers and brought
the results back to the company. His insights were as fol ows:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
Successful professional money managers felt they had nothing to fear
from transparency, since they believed it would validate their skil
s.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
Money managers faced signi cant chal enges in managing and scaling
their own businesses. They were hampered by the di culty of servicing
their own accounts and therefore had to require high minimum
investments as a way to screen new clients.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
second problem was so severe that Wealthfront was elding cold cal s
from professional managers asking out of the blue to join the
platform. These were classic early adopters who had the vision to see
past the current product to something they could use to achieve a
competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
second critical qualitative information came out of conversations
with consumers. It turned out that they found the blending of virtual
and real portfolio management on the kaChing website confusing. Far
from being a clever way of acquiring customers, the freemium strategy
was get ing in the way by promoting confusion about the company’s
positioning.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
data informed the pivot or persevere meeting. With everyone present,
the team debated what to do with its future. The current strategy
wasn’t working, but many employees were nervous about abandoning
the online game. After al , it was an important part of what they had
signed on to build. They had invested signi cant time and energy
building and supporting those customers. It was painful—as it
always is—to realize that that energy had been wasted.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Wealthfront
decided it could not persevere as it existed. The company chose
instead to celebrate what it had learned. If it had</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	company
chose instead to celebrate what it had learned. If it had not
launched its current product, the team never would have learned what
it needed to know to pivot. In fact, the experience taught them
something essential about their vision. As Andy says,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“What
we real y wanted to change was not who manages the money but who has
access to the best possible talent. We’d original y thought we’d
need to build a signi cant business with amateur managers to get
professionals to come on board, but fortunately it turns out that
wasn’t necessary.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
company pivoted, abandoning the gaming customers altogether and
focusing on providing a service that al owed customers to invest with
professional managers. On the surface, the pivot seems quite dramatic
in that the company changed its positioning, its name, and its
partner strategy. It even jet isoned a large proportion of the
features it had built. But at its core, a surprising amount stayed
the same. The most valuable work the company had done was building
technology to evaluate managers’</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	e
ectiveness, and this became the kernel around which the new business
was built. This is also common with pivots; it is not necessary to
throw out everything that came before and start over.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead,
it’s about repurposing what has been built and what has been
learned to find a more positive direction.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Today,
Wealthfront is prospering as a result of its pivot, with over $180
mil ion invested on the platform and more than forty professional
managers.3 It recently was named one of Fast Company’s ten most
innovative companies in nance.4 The company continues to operate with
agility, scaling in line with the growth principles outlined in
Chapter 12. Wealthfront is also a leading advocate of the development
technique known as continuous deployment, which we’l discuss in
Chapter 9.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>FAILURE
TO PIVOT</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
decision to pivot is so di cult that many companies fail to make it.
I wish I could say that every time I was confronted with the need to
pivot, I handled it wel , but this is far from true. I</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	the
need to pivot, I handled it wel , but this is far from true. I
remember one failure to pivot especial y wel .</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
few years after IMVU’s founding, the company was having tremendous
success. The business had grown to over $1 mil ion per month in
revenue; we had created more than twenty mil ion avatars for our
customers. We managed to raise signi cant new rounds of nancing, and
like the global economy, we were riding high. But danger lurked
around the corner.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unknowingly,
we had fal en into a classic startup trap. We had been so successful
with our early e orts that we were ignoring the principles behind
them. As a result, we missed the need to pivot even as it stared us
in the face.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
had built an organization that excel ed at the kinds of activities
described in earlier chapters: creating minimum viable products to
test new ideas and running experiments to tune the engine of growth.
Before we had begun to enjoy success, many people had advised against
our “low-quality” minimum viable product and experimental
approach, urging us to slow down. They wanted us to do things right
and focus on quality instead of speed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
ignored that advice, mostly because we wanted to claim the advantages
of speed. After our approach was vindicated, the advice we received
changed. Now most of the advice we heard was that</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“you
can’t argue with success,” urging us to stay the course. We liked
this advice bet er, but it was equal y wrong.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Remember
that the rationale for building low-quality MVPs is that developing
any features beyond what early adopters require is a form of waste.
However, the logic of this takes you only so far.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Once
you have found success with early adopters, you want to sel to
mainstream customers. Mainstream customers have di erent requirements
and are much more demanding.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
kind of pivot we needed is cal ed a customer segment pivot.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
this pivot, the company realizes that the product it’s building
solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the
customers it original y planned to serve. In other words, the product
hypothesis is con rmed only partial y. (This chapter described such a
pivot in the Votizen story, above.)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
customer segment pivot is an especial y tricky pivot to execute</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
customer segment pivot is an especial y tricky pivot to execute
because, as we learned the hard way at IMVU, the very actions that
made us successful with early adopters were diametrical y opposed to
the actions we’d have to master to be successful with mainstream
customers. We lacked a clear understanding of how our engine of
growth operated. We had begun to trust our vanity metrics. We had
stopped using learning milestones to hold ourselves accountable.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead,
it was much more convenient to focus on the ever-larger gross metrics
that were so exciting: breaking new records in signing up paying
customers and active users, monitoring our customer retention
rate—you name it. Under the surface, it should have been clear that
our ef orts at tuning the engine were reaching diminishing returns,
the classic sign of the need to pivot.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, we spent months trying to improve the product’s activation
rate (the rate at which new customers become active consumers of the
product), which remained stubbornly low. We did countless
experiments: usability improvements, new persuasion techniques,
incentive programs, customer quests, and other gamelike features.
Individual y, many of these new features and new marketing tools were
successful. We measured them rigorously, using A/B experimentation.
But taken in aggregate, over the course of many months, we were
seeing negligible changes in the overal drivers of our engine of
growth. Even our activation rate, which had been the center of our
focus, edged up only a few percentage points.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
ignored the signs because the company was stil growing, delivering
month after month of “up and to the right” results. But we were
quickly exhausting our early adopter market. It was get ing harder
and harder to nd customers we could acquire at the prices we were
accustomed to paying. As we drove our marketing team to nd more
customers, they were forced to reach out more to mainstream
customers, but mainstream customers are less forgiving of an early
product. The activation and monetization rates of new customers
started to go down, driving up the cost of acquiring new customers.
Pret y soon, our growth was atlining and our engine sput ered and
stal ed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
took us far too long to make the changes necessary to x this</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
took us far too long to make the changes necessary to x this
situation. As with al pivots, we had to get back to basics and start
the innovation accounting cycle over. It felt like the company’s
second founding. We had got en real y good at optimizing, tuning, and
iterating, but in the process we had lost sight of the purpose of
those activities: testing a clear hypothesis in the service of the
company’s vision. Instead, we were chasing growth, revenue, and
profits wherever we could find them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
needed to reacquaint ourselves with our new mainstream customers. Our
interaction designers led the way by developing a clear customer
archetype that was based on extensive in-person conversations and
observation. Next, we needed to invest heavily in a major product
overhaul designed to make the product dramatical y easier to use.
Because of our overfocus on ne-tuning, we had stopped making large
investments like these, preferring to invest in lower-risk and
lower-yield testing experiments.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
investing in quality, design, and larger projects did not require
that we abandon our experimental roots. On the contrary, once we
realized our mistake and executed the pivot, those skil s served us
wel . We created a sandbox for experimentation like the one described
in Chapter 12 and had a cross-functional team work exclusively on
this major redesign. As they built, they continuously tested their
new design head to head against the old one. Initial y, the new
design performed worse than the old one, as is usual y the case. It
lacked the features and functionality of the old design and had many
new mistakes as wel . But the team relentlessly improved the design
until, months later, it performed bet er. This new design laid the
foundation for our future growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
foundation has paid o handsomely. By 2009, revenue had more than
doubled to over $25 mil ion annual y. But we might have enjoyed that
success earlier if we had pivoted sooner.5</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Zoom-in
Pivot</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
this case, what previously was considered a single feature in a
product becomes the whole product. This is the type of pivot Votizen
made when it pivoted away from a ful social network and toward a
simple voter contact product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Zoom-out
Pivot</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
the reverse situation, sometimes a single feature is insu cient to
support a whole product. In this type of pivot, what was considered
the whole product becomes a single feature of a much larger product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Customer
Segment Pivot</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
this pivot, the company realizes that the product it is building
solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the
type of customers it original y planned to serve. In other words, the
product hypothesis is partial y con rmed, solving the right problem,
but for a dif erent customer than original y anticipated.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Customer
Need Pivot</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
a result of get ing to know customers extremely wel , it sometimes
becomes clear that the problem we’re trying to solve for them is
not very important. However, because of this customer intimacy, we
often discover other related problems that are important and can be
solved by our team. In many cases, these related problems may require
lit le more than repositioning the</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	related
problems may require lit le more than repositioning the existing
product. In other cases, it may require a completely new product.
Again, this a case where the product hypothesis is partial y con
rmed; the target customer has a problem worth solving, just not the
one that was original y anticipated.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
famous example is the chain Potbel y Sandwich Shop, which today has
over two hundred stores. It began as an antique store in 1977; the
owners started to sel sandwiches as a way to bolster tra c to their
stores. Pret y soon they had pivoted their way into an entirely dif
erent line of business.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Platform
Pivot</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
platform pivot refers to a change from an application to a platform
or vice versa. Most commonly, startups that aspire to create a new
platform begin life by sel ing a single application, the so-cal ed
kil er app, for their platform. Only later does the platform emerge
as a vehicle for third parties to leverage as a way to create their
own related products. However, this order is not always set in stone,
and some companies have to execute this pivot multiple times.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Business
Architecture Pivot</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
pivot borrows a concept from Geo rey Moore, who observed that
companies general y fol ow one of two major business architectures:
high margin, low volume (complex systems model) or low margin, high
volume (volume operations model).6 The former commonly is associated
with business to business (B2B) or enterprise sales cycles, and the
lat er with consumer products (there are notable exceptions). In a
business architecture pivot, a startup switches architectures. Some
companies change from high margin, low volume by going mass market
(e.g., Google’s search</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“appliance”);
others, original y designed for the mass market, turned out to
require long and expensive sales cycles.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Value
Capture Pivot</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
are many ways to capture the value a company creates. These methods
are referred to commonly as monetization or revenue models. These
terms are much too limiting. Implicit in the idea of monetization is
that it is a separate “feature” of a product that can be added or
removed at wil . In reality, capturing value is an intrinsic part of
the product hypothesis. Often, changes to the way a company captures
value can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the
business, product, and marketing strategies.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Engine
of Growth Pivot</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
we’l see in Chapter 10, there are three primary engines of growth
that power startups: the viral, sticky, and paid growth models. In
this type of pivot, a company changes its growth strategy to seek
faster or more profitable growth. Commonly but not always, the engine
of growth also requires a change in the way value is captured.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Channel
Pivot</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
traditional sales terminology, the mechanism by which a company
delivers its product to customers is cal ed the sales channel or
distribution channel. For example, consumer packaged goods are sold
in a grocery store, cars are sold in dealerships, and much enterprise
software is sold (with extensive customization) by consulting and
professional services rms. Often, the requirements of the channel
determine the price, features, and competitive landscape of a
product. A channel pivot is a recognition that the same basic
solution could be delivered through a di erent channel with greater e
ectiveness. Whenever a company abandons a previously complex sales
process to “sel direct” to its end users, a channel pivot is in
progress.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	channel
pivot is in progress.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
is precisely because of its destructive e ect on sales channels that
the Internet has had such a disruptive in uence in industries that
previously required complex sales and distribution channels, such as
newspaper, magazine, and book publishing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Technology
Pivot</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Occasional
y, a company discovers a way to achieve the same solution by using a
completely di erent technology. Technology pivots are much more
common in established businesses. In other words, they are a
sustaining innovation, an incremental improvement designed to appeal
to and retain an existing customer base. Established companies excel
at this kind of pivot because so much is not changing. The customer
segment is the same, the customer’s problem is the same, the
value-capture model is the same, and the channel partners are the
same. The only question is whether the new technology can provide
superior price and/or performance compared with the existing
technology.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
PIVOT IS A STRATEGIC HYPOTHESIS</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Although
the pivots identi ed above wil be familiar to students of business
strategy, the ability to pivot is no substitute for sound strategic
thinking. The problem with providing famous examples of pivots is
that most people are familiar only with the successful end strategies
of famous companies. Most readers know that Southwest or Walmart is
an example of a low-cost disruption in their markets, that Microsoft
an example of a platform monopoly, and that Starbucks has leveraged a
powerful premium brand. What is general y less wel known are the
pivots that were required to discover those strategies. Companies
have a strong incentive to align their PR stories around the heroic
founder and make it seem that their success was the inevitable result
of a good idea.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Thus,
although startups often pivot into a strategy that seems</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Thus,
although startups often pivot into a strategy that seems similar to
that of a successful company, it is important not to put too much
stock in these analogies. It’s extremely di cult to know if the
analogy has been drawn properly. Have we copied the essential
features or just super cial ones? Wil what worked in that industry
work in ours? Wil what has worked in the past work today? A pivot is
bet er understood as a new strategic hypothesis that wil require a
new minimum viable product to test.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Pivots
are a permanent fact of life for any growing business. Even after a
company achieves initial success, it must continue to pivot.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Those
familiar with the technology life cycle ideas of theorists such as
Geo rey Moore know certain later-stage pivots by the names he has
given them: the Chasm, the Tornado, the Bowling Al ey.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Readers
of the disruptive innovation literature spearheaded by Harvard’s
Clayton Christensen wil be familiar with established companies that
fail to pivot when they should. The critical skil for managers today
is to match those theories to their present situation so that they
apply the right advice at the right time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Modern
managers cannot have escaped the deluge of recent books cal ing on

Many of the works in this category are long on exhortations and short

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A

kind of structured change designed to test a new fundamental
hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth.
It is the heart of the Lean Startup method. It is what makes the

understand this distinction, you can begin using lean techniques to

be adapted to the unique circumstances of entrepreneurship. Recal
from Chapter 3 that value in a startup is not the creation of stu ,
but rather validated learning about how to build a sustainable
business. What products do customers real y want? How wil our
business grow? Who is our customer? Which customers should we listen
to and which should we ignore? These are the questions that need
answering as quickly as possible to maximize a startup’s chances of
success. That is what creates value for a startup.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I n
Part Three, we wil develop techniques that al ow Lean Startups to
grow without sacri cing the speed and agility that are the lifeblood
of every startup. Contrary to common belief, lethargy and bureaucracy
are not the inevitable fate of companies as they achieve maturity. I
believe that with the proper foundation, Lean Startups can grow to

orientation, and culture of innovation even as they scale.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
Chapter 9, we wil see how Lean Startups take advantage of the
counterintuitive power of smal batches. Just as lean manufacturing
has pursued a just-in-time approach to building products, reducing
the need for in-process inventory, Lean Startups practice
just-in-time scalability, conducting product experiments without
making massive up-front investments in planning and design.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Chapter

growth as they add new customers and discover new markets.
Sustainable growth fol ows one of three engines of growth: paid,
viral, or sticky. By identifying which engine of growth a startup is
using, it can then direct energy where it wil be most e ective in
growing the business. Each engine requires a focus on unique metrics
to evaluate the success of new products and prioritize new
experiments. When used with the innovation accounting method

dysfunctional. We also wil see how lean disciplines set the stage for
a startup to transition into an established company driven by
operational excel ence.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I n
Chapter 12, we’l come ful circle. As startups grow into established
companies, they face the same pressures that make it necessary for
today’s enterprises to nd new ways to invest in disruptive
innovation. In fact, we’l see that an advantage of a successful
startup’s rapid growth is that the company can keep its
entrepreneurial DNA even as it matures. Today’s companies must
learn to master a management portfolio of sustainable and disruptive
innovation. It is an obsolete view that sees startups as going
through discrete phases that leave earlier kinds of work—</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	such
as innovation—behind. Rather, modern companies must excel at doing
multiple kinds of work in paral el. To do so, we’l explore
techniques for incubating innovation teams within the context of an

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
have included an epilogue cal ed “Waste Not” in which I consider
some of the broader implications of the success of the Lean Startup
movement, place it in historical context (including cautionary
lessons from past movements), and make suggestions for its future
direction.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	9BATCH</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
the book Lean Thinking, James Womack and Daniel Jones recount a story
of stu ng newslet ers into envelopes with the assistance of one of
the author’s two young children. Every envelope had to be
addressed, stamped, l ed with a let er, and sealed. The daughters,
age six and nine, knew how they should go about completing the
project: “Daddy, rst you should fold al of the newslet ers. Then
you should at ach the seal. Then you should put on the stamps.”
Their father wanted to do it the counterintuitive way: complete each
envelope one at a time. They</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	—like
most of us—thought that was backward, explaining to him</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“that
wouldn’t be ef icient!” He and his daughters each took half the
envelopes and competed to see who would finish first.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
father won the race, and not just because he is an adult. It happened
because the one envelope at a time approach is a faster way of get
ing the job done even though it seems ine cient. This has been con
rmed in many studies, including one that was recorded on video.1</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
one envelope at a time approach is cal ed “single-piece ow” in
lean manufacturing. It works because of the surprising power of smal
batches. When we do work that proceeds in stages, the “batch size”
refers to how much work moves from one stage to the next at a time.
For example, if we were stu ng one hundred envelopes, the intuitive
way to do it—folding one hundred let ers at a time—would have a
batch size of one hundred. Single-piece ow is so named because it has
a batch size of one.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	is
so named because it has a batch size of one.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Why
does stu ng one envelope at a time get the job done faster even
though it seems like it would be slower? Because our intuition
doesn’t take into account the extra time required to sort, stack,
and move around the large piles of half-complete envelopes when it’s
done the other way.2 It seems more ef icient to repeat the same task
over and over, in part because we expect that we wil get bet er at
this simple task the more we do it. Unfortunately, in
process-oriented work like this, individual performance is not nearly
as important as the overal performance of the system.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Even
if the amount of time that each process took was exactly the same,
the smal batch production approach stil would be superior, and for
even more counterintuitive reasons. For example, imagine that the let
ers didn’t t in the envelopes. With the large-batch approach, we
wouldn’t nd that out until nearly the end. With smal batches, we’d
know almost immediately. What if the envelopes are defective and
won’t seal? In the large-batch approach, we’d have to unstu al
the envelopes, get new ones, and restu them. In the smal -batch
approach, we’d nd this out immediately and have no rework required.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Al
these issues are visible in a process as simple as stu ng envelopes,
but they are of real and much greater consequence in the work of
every company, large or smal . The smal -batch approach produces a
nished product every few seconds, whereas the large-batch approach
must deliver al the products at once, at the end.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Imagine
what this might look like if the time horizon was hours, days, or
weeks. What if it turns out that the customers have decided they
don’t want the product? Which process would al ow a company to find
this out sooner?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Lean
manufacturers discovered the bene ts of smal batches decades ago. In
the post–World War I economy, Japanese carmakers such as Toyota
could not compete with huge American factories that used the latest
mass production techniques. Fol owing the intuitively e cient way of
building, mass production factories built cars by using ever-larger
batch sizes. They would spend huge amounts of money buying machines
that could produce car parts by</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	amounts
of money buying machines that could produce car parts by the tens,
hundreds, or thousands. By keeping those machines running at peak
speed, they could drive down the unit cost of each part and produce
cars that were incredibly inexpensive so long as they were completely
uniform.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Japanese car market was far too smal for companies such as Toyota to
employ those economies of scale; thus, Japanese companies faced
intense pressure from mass production. Also, in the war-ravaged
Japanese economy, capital was not available for massive investments
in large machines.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
was against this backdrop that innovators such as Tai chi Ohno,
Shigeo Shingo, and others found a way to succeed by using smal
batches. Instead of buying large specialized machines that could
produce thousands of parts at a time, Toyota used smal er
general-purpose machines that could produce a wide variety of parts
in smal batches. This required guring out ways to recon gure each
machine rapidly to make the right part at the right time. By focusing
on this “changeover time,” Toyota was able to produce entire
automobiles by using smal batches throughout the process.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
rapid changing of machines was no easy feat. As in any lean
transformation, existing systems and tools often need to be
reinvented to support working in smal er batches. Shigeo Shingo
created the concept of SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) in order
to enable a smal er batch size of work in early Toyota factories. He
was so relentless in rethinking the way machines were operated that
he was able to reduce changeover times that previously took hours to
less than ten minutes. He did this, not by asking workers to work
faster, but by reimagining and restructuring the work that needed to
be done. Every investment in bet er tools and process had a
corresponding bene t in terms of shrinking the batch size of work.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Because
of its smal er batch size, Toyota was able to produce a much greater
diversity of products. It was no longer necessary that each product
be exactly the same to gain the economies of scale that powered mass
production. Thus, Toyota could serve its smal er, more fragmented
markets and stil compete with the mass producers. Over time, that
capability al owed Toyota to move</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	producers.
Over time, that capability al owed Toyota to move successful y into
larger and larger markets until it became the world’s largest
automaker in 2008.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
biggest advantage of working in smal batches is that quality problems
can be identi ed much sooner. This is the origin of Toyota’s famous
andon cord, which al ows any worker to ask for help as soon as they
notice any problem, such as a defect in a physical part, stopping the
entire production line if it cannot be corrected immediately. This is
another very counterintuitive practice. An assembly line works best
when it is functioning smoothly, rol ing car after car o the end of
the line. The andon cord can interrupt this careful ow as the line is
halted repeatedly.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
the bene ts of nding and xing problems faster outweigh this cost.
This process of continuously driving out defects has been a win-win
for Toyota and its customers. It is the root cause of Toyota’s
historic high quality ratings and low costs.</p>

BATCHES IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
I teach entrepreneurs this method, I often begin with stories about
manufacturing. Before long, I can see the questioning looks: what
does this have to do with my startup? The theory that is the
foundation of Toyota’s success can be used to dramatical y improve
the speed at which startups find validated learning.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Toyota
discovered that smal batches made their factories more e cient. In
contrast, in the Lean Startup the goal is not to produce more stu e
ciently. It is to—as quickly as possible—learn how to build a
sustainable business.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Think
back to the example of envelope stu ng. What if it turns out that the

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Although
this is never good news for an entrepreneur, nding out sooner is much
bet er than nding out later. Working in smal batches ensures that a
startup can minimize the expenditure of time, money, and e ort that

Normal y, new versions of products like ours are released to
customers on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly cycle.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Take
a look at your cel phone. Odds are, it is not the very rst version of
its kind. Even innovative companies such as Apple produce a new

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Bundled
up in that product release are dozens of new features (at the release
of iPhone 4, Apple boasted more than 1,500 changes).</p>

y, many high-tech products are manufactured in advanced facilities
that fol ow the latest in lean thinking, including smal batches and

product is stuck in the era of mass production.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Think

1,500 of them are released to customers in one giant batch.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Behind
the scenes, in the development and design of the product itself,
large batches are stil the rule. The work that goes into the
development of a new product proceeds on a virtual assembly line.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Product
managers gure out what features are likely to please customers;
product designers then gure out how those features should look and

way the product managers and designers intended. For a product such
as the iPhone, these internal handof s may happen on a monthly or
quarterly basis.</p>

back one more time to the envelope-stu ng exercise.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
is the most ef icient way to do this work?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	At
IMVU, we at empted to design, develop, and ship our new features one
at a time, taking advantage of the power of smal batches. Here’s
what it looked like.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead
of working in separate departments, engineers and designers would
work together side by side on one feature at a time. Whenever that
feature was ready to be tested with customers,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	time.
Whenever that feature was ready to be tested with customers, they
immediately would release a new version of the product, which would
go live on our website for a relatively smal number of people. The
team would be able immediately to assess the impact of their work,
evaluate its e ect on customers, and decide what to do next. For tiny
changes, the whole process might be repeated several times per day.
In fact, in the aggregate, IMVU</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	makes
about fty changes to its product (on average) every single day.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Just
as with the Toyota Production System, the key to being able to
operate this quickly is to check for defects immediately, thus
preventing bigger problems later. For example, we had an extensive
set of automated tests that assured that after every change our
product stil worked as designed. Let’s say an engineer accidental y
removed an important feature, such as the checkout but on on one of
our e-commerce pages. Without this but on, customers no longer could
buy anything from IMVU. It’s as if our business instantly became a
hobby. Analogously to the Toyota andon cord, IMVU used an elaborate
set of defense mechanisms that prevented engineers from accidental y
breaking something important.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
cal ed this our product’s immune system because those automatic
protections went beyond checking that the product behaved as
expected. We also continuously monitored the health of our business
itself so that mistakes were found and removed automatical y.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Going
back to our business-to-hobby example of the missing checkout but on,
let’s make the problem a lit le more interesting.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Imagine
that instead of removing the but on altogether, an engineer makes a
mistake and changes the but on’s color so that it is now white on a
white background. From the point of view of automated functional
tests, the but on is stil there and everything is working normal y;
from the customer’s point of view, the but on is gone, and so
nobody can buy anything. This class of problems is hard to detect
solely with automation but is stil catastrophic from a business point
of view. At IMVU, our immune system is programmed to detect these
business consequences and</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	programmed
to detect these business consequences and automatical y invoke our
equivalent of the andon cord.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
our immune system detects a problem, a number of things happen
immediately:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
The defective change is removed immediately and automatical y.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
Everyone on the relevant team is notified of the problem.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
The team is blocked from introducing any further changes, preventing
the problem from being compounded by future mistakes …</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	4.
… until the root cause of the problem is found and xed. (This root
cause analysis is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 11.) At
IMVU, we cal ed this continuous deployment, and even in the
fast-moving world of software development it is stil considered
controversial.3 As the Lean Startup movement has gained traction, it
has come to be embraced by more and more startups, even those that
operate mission-critical applications. Among the most cut ing edge
examples is Wealthfront, whose pivot was described in Chapter 8. The
company practices true continuous deployment—</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	including
more than a dozen releases to customers every day—in an
SEC-regulated environment.4</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Continuous
Deployment Beyond Software</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
I tel this story to people who work in a slower-moving industry, they
think I am describing something futuristic. But increasingly, more
and more industries are seeing their design process accelerated by
the same underlying forces that make this kind of rapid iteration
possible in the software industry. There are three ways in which this
is happening:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
Hardware becoming software. Think about what has happened in consumer
electronics. The latest phones and tablet computers are</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	in
consumer electronics. The latest phones and tablet computers are lit
le more than a screen connected to the Internet. Almost al of their
value is determined by their software. Even old-school products such
as automobiles are seeing ever-larger parts of their value being
generated by the software they carry inside, which controls
everything from the entertainment system to tuning the engine to
control ing the brakes. What can be built out of software can be modi
ed much faster than a physical or mechanical device can.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
Fast production changes. Because of the success of the lean
manufacturing movement, many assembly lines are set up to al ow each
new product that comes o the line to be customized completely without
sacri cing quality or cost-e ectiveness.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Historical
y, this has been used to o er the customer many choices of product,
but in the future, this capability wil al ow the designers of
products to get much faster feedback about new versions. When the
design changes, there is no excess inventory of the old version to
slow things down. Since machines are designed for rapid changeovers,
as soon as the new design is ready, new versions can be produced
quickly.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
3D printing and rapid prototyping tools. As just one example, most
products and parts that are made out of plastic today are mass
produced using a technique cal ed injection molding. This process is
extremely expensive and time-consuming to set up, but once it is up
and running, it can reproduce hundreds of thousands of identical
individual items at an extremely low cost. It is a classic
large-batch production process. This has put entrepreneurs who want
to develop a new physical product at a disadvantage, since in general
only large companies can a ord these large production runs for a new
product. However, new technologies are al owing entrepreneurs to
build smal batches of products that are of the same quality as
products made with injection molding, but at much lower cost and
much, much faster.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
essential lesson is not that everyone should be shipping fty times
per day but that by reducing batch size, we can get through the
Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop more quickly than our competitors
can. The ability to learn faster from customers is the essential
competitive advantage that startups must possess.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>SMALL
BATCHES IN ACTION</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
see this process in action, let me introduce you to a company in
Boise, Idaho, cal ed SGW Designworks. SGW’s specialty is rapid
production techniques for physical products. Many of its clients are
startups.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	SGW
Designworks was engaged by a client who had been asked by a military
customer to build a complex eld x-ray system to detect explosives and
other destructive devices at border crossings and in war zones.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Conceptual
y, the system consisted of an advanced head unit that read x-ray lm,
multiple x-ray lm panels, and the framework to hold the panels while
the lm was being exposed. The client already had the technology for
the x-ray panels and the head unit, but to make the product work in
rugged military set ings, SGW</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	needed
to design and deliver the supporting structure that would make the
technology usable in the eld. The framework had to be stable to
ensure a quality x-ray image, durable enough for use in a war zone,
easy to deploy with minimal training, and smal enough to col apse
into a backpack.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is precisely the kind of product we are accustomed to thinking takes
months or years to develop, yet new techniques are shrinking that
time line. SGW immediately began to generate the visual prototypes by
using 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software. The 3D models served
as a rapid communication tool between the client and the SGW team to
make early design decisions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
team and client set led on a design that used an advanced</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
team and client set led on a design that used an advanced locking
hinge to provide the col apsibility required without compromising
stability. The design also integrated a suction cup/pump mechanism to
al ow for fast, repeatable at achment to the x-ray panels. Sounds
complicated, right?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Three
days later, the SGW team delivered the rst physical prototypes to the
client. The prototypes were machined out of aluminum directly from
the 3D model, using a technique cal ed computer numerical control
(CNC) and were hand assembled by the SGW team.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
client immediately took the prototypes to its military contact for
review. The general concept was accepted with a number of minor
design modi cations. In the next ve days, another ful cycle of design
iteration, prototyping, and design review was completed by the client
and SGW. The rst production run of forty completed units was ready
for delivery three and a half weeks after the initiation of the
development project.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	SGW
realized that this was a winning model because feedback on design
decisions was nearly instantaneous. The team used the same process to
design and deliver eight products, serving a wide range of functions,
in a twelve-month period. Half of those products are generating
revenue today, and the rest are awaiting initial orders, al thanks to
the power of working in smal batches.</p>

methods. A signi cant amount of work may be needed to enable
innovators to experiment in smal batches. As was pointed out in
Chapter 2, for established companies looking to accelerate their
innovation teams, building this platform for experimentation is the
responsibility of senior management.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Imagine
that you are a schoolteacher in charge of teaching math to middle
school students. Although you may teach concepts in smal batches, one
day at a time, your overal curriculum cannot change very often.
Because you must set up the curriculum in advance and teach the same
concepts in the same order to every student in the classroom, you can
try a new curriculum at most only once a year.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	How
could a math teacher experiment with smal batches? Under the current
large-batch system for educating students, it would be quite di cult;
our current educational system was designed in the era of mass
production and uses large batches extensively.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
new breed of startups is working hard to change al that. In School of
One, students have daily “playlists” of their learning tasks that
are at uned to each student’s learning needs, based on that
student’s readiness and learning style. For example, Julia is way
ahead of grade level in math and learns best in smal groups, so her
playlist might include three or four videos matched to her aptitude
level, a thirty-minute one-on-one tutoring session with her teacher,
and a smal group activity in which she works on a math puzzle with
three peers at similar aptitude levels. There are assessments built
into each activity so that data can be fed back to the teacher to
choose appropriate tasks for the next playlist. This data can be
aggregated across classes, schools, or even whole districts.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Now
imagine trying to experiment with a curriculum by using a tool such
as School of One. Each student is working at his or her own pace.
Let’s say you are a teacher who has a new sequence in mind for how
math concepts should be taught. You can see immediately the impact of
the change on those of your students who are at that point in the
curriculum. If you judge it to be a good change, you could rol it out
immediately for every single student;</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	change,
you could rol it out immediately for every single student; when they
get to that part of the curriculum, they wil get the new sequence
automatical y. In other words, tools like School of One enable
teachers to work in much smal er batches, to the bene t of their
students. (And, as tools reach wide-scale adoption, successful
experiments by individual teachers can be rol ed out district-,
city-, or even nationwide.) This approach is having an impact and
earning accolades. Time magazine recently included School of One in
its “most innovative ideas” list; it was the only educational
organization to make the list.5</p>

LARGE-BATCH DEATH SPIRAL</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Smal
batches pose a chal enge to managers steeped in traditional notions
of productivity and progress, because they believe that functional
specialization is more ef icient for expert workers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Imagine
you’re a product designer overseeing a new product and you need to
produce thirty individual design drawings. It probably seems that the
most e cient way to work is in seclusion, by yourself, producing the
designs one by one. Then, when you’re done with al of them, you
pass the drawings on to the engineering team and let them work. In
other words, you work in large batches.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	From
the point of view of individual e ciency, working in large batches
makes sense. It also has other bene ts: it promotes skil building,
makes it easier to hold individual contributors accountable, and,
most important, al ows experts to work without interruption. At least
that’s the theory. Unfortunately, reality seldom works out that
way.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Consider
our hypothetical example. After passing thirty design drawings to
engineering, the designer is free to turn his or her at ention to the
next project. But remember the problems that came up during the
envelope-stu ng exercise. What happens when engineering has questions
about how the drawings are supposed to work? What if some of the
drawings are unclear? What if something goes wrong when engineering
at empts to use the drawings?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	drawings?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
problems inevitably turn into interruptions for the designer, and now
those interruptions are interfering with the next large batch the
designer is supposed to be working on. If the drawings need to be
redone, the engineers may become idle while they wait for the rework
to be completed. If the designer is not available, the engineers may
have to redo the designs themselves.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is why so few products are actual y built the way they are designed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
I work with product managers and designers in companies that use
large batches, I often discover that they have to redo their work ve
or six times for every release. One product manager I worked with was
so inundated with interruptions that he took to coming into the o ce
in the middle of the night so that he could work uninterrupted. When
I suggested that he try switching the work process from large-batch
to single-piece ow, he refused—</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	because
that would be ine cient! So strong is the instinct to work in large
batches, that even when a large-batch system is malfunctioning, we
have a tendency to blame ourselves.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Large
batches tend to grow over time. Because moving the batch forward
often results in additional work, rework, delays, and interruptions,
everyone has an incentive to do work in ever-larger batches, trying
to minimize this overhead. This is cal ed the large-batch death
spiral because, unlike in manufacturing, there are no physical limits
on the maximum size of a batch.6 It is possible for batch size to
keep growing and growing. Eventual y, one batch wil become the
highest-priority project, a “bet the company” new version of the
product, because the company has taken such a long time since the
last release. But now the managers are incentivized to increase batch
size rather than ship the product. In light of how long the product
has been in development, why not x one more bug or add one more
feature? Who real y wants to be the manager who risked the success of
this huge release by failing to address a potential y critical flaw?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
worked at a company that entered this death spiral. We had been
working for months on a new version of a real y cool product.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
original version had been years in the making, and expectations for
the next release were incredibly high. But the longer we worked, the
more afraid we became of how customers would react when they nal y
saw the new version. As our plans became more ambitious, so too did
the number of bugs, con icts, and problems we had to deal with. Pret
y soon we got into a situation in which we could not ship anything.
Our launch date seemed to recede into the distance. The more work we
got done, the more work we had to do. The lack of ability to ship
eventual y precipitated a crisis and a change of management, al
because of the trap of large batches.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
misconceptions about batch size are incredibly common.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Hospital
pharmacies often deliver big batches of medications to patient oors
once a day because it’s e cient (a single trip, right?).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	But
many of those meds get sent back to the pharmacy when a patient’s
orders have changed or the patient is moved or discharged, causing
the pharmacy staf to do lots of rework and reprocessing (or trashing)
of meds. Delivering smal er batches every four hours reduces the
total workload for the pharmacy and ensures that the right meds are
at the right place when needed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Hospital
lab blood col ections often are done in hourly batches; phlebotomists
col ect blood for an hour from multiple patients and then send or
take al the samples to the lab. This adds to turnaround time for test
results and can harm test quality. It has become common for hospitals
to bring smal batches (two patients) or a single-patient ow of
specimens to the lab even if they have to hire an extra phlebotomist
or two to do so, because the total system cost is lower.7</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	and
wait to hear the bad news. The repair technician tel s you that you
need to have the bumper replaced. He goes to check their inventory
levels and tel s you he has a new bumper in stock and they can
complete your repair immediately. This is good news for everyone—you
because you get your car back sooner and the dealership because they
have a happy customer and don’t run the risk of your taking the car
somewhere else for repair. Also, they don’t have to store your car
or give you a loaner while they wait for the part to come in.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
traditional mass production, the way to avoid stockouts—not having
the product the customer wants—is to keep a large inventory of
spares just in case. It may be that the blue 2011 Camry bumper is
quite popular, but what about last year’s model or the model from
ve years ago? The more inventory you keep, the greater the likelihood
you wil have the right product in stock for every customer. But large
inventories are expensive because they have to be transported,
stored, and tracked. What if the 2011</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	bumper
turns out to have a defect? Al the spares in al the warehouses
instantly become waste.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Lean
production solves the problem of stockouts with a technique cal ed
pul . When you bring a car into the dealership for repair, one blue
2011 Camry bumper gets used. This creates a</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“hole”
in the dealer’s inventory, which automatical y causes a signal to
be sent to a local restocking facility cal ed the Toyota Parts
Distribution Center (PDC). The PDC sends the dealer a new bumper,
which creates another hole in inventory. This sends a similar signal
to a regional warehouse cal ed the Toyota Parts Redistribution Center
(PRC), where al parts suppliers ship their products. That warehouse
signals the factory where the bumpers are made to produce one more
bumper, which is manufactured and shipped to the PRC.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
ideal goal is to achieve smal batches al the way down to single-piece
ow along the entire supply chain. Each step in the line pul s the
parts it needs from the previous step. This is the famous Toyota
just-in-time production method.8</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
companies switch to this kind of production, their</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
companies switch to this kind of production, their warehouses
immediately shrink, as the amount of just-in-case inventory [cal ed
work-in-progress (WIP) inventory] is reduced dramatical y. This
almost magical shrinkage of WIP is where lean manufacturing gets its
name. It’s as if the whole supply chain suddenly went on a diet.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Startups
struggle to see their work-in-progress inventory. When factories have
excess WIP, it literal y piles up on the factory oor.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Because
most startup work is intangible, it’s not nearly as visible.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, al the work that goes into designing the minimum viable
product is—until the moment that product is shipped—just WIP
inventory. Incomplete designs, not-yet-validated assumptions, and
most business plans are WIP. Almost every Lean Startup technique
we’ve discussed so far works its magic in two ways: by converting
push methods to pul and reducing batch size. Both have the net ef ect
of reducing WIP.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
manufacturing, pul is used primarily to make sure production
processes are tuned to levels of customer demand. Without this,
factories can wind up making much more—or much less—of a product
than customers real y want. However, applying this approach to
developing new products is not straightforward. Some people
misunderstand the Lean Startup model as simply applying pul to
customer wants. This assumes that customers could tel us what
products to build and that this would act as the pul signal to
product development to make them.9</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
was mentioned earlier, this is not the way the Lean Startup model
works, because customers often don’t know what they want.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Our
goal in building products is to be able to run experiments that wil
help us learn how to build a sustainable business. Thus, the right
way to think about the product development process in a Lean Startup
is that it is responding to pul requests in the form of experiments
that need to be run.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
soon as we formulate a hypothesis that we want to test, the product
development team should be engineered to design and run this
experiment as quickly as possible, using the smal est batch size that
wil get the job done. Remember that although we write the</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	that
wil get the job done. Remember that although we write the feedback
loop as Build-Measure-Learn because the activities happen in that
order, our planning real y works in the reverse order: we gure out
what we need to learn and then work backwards to see what product wil
work as an experiment to get that learning. Thus, it is not the
customer, but rather our hypothesis about the customer, that pul s
work from product development and other functions. Any other work is
waste.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Hypothesis
Pul in Clean Tech</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
see this in action, let’s take a look at Berkeley-based startup
Alphabet Energy. Any machine or process that generates power, whether
it is a motor in a factory or a coal-burning power plant, generates
heat as a by-product. Alphabet Energy has developed a product that
can generate electricity from this waste heat, using a new kind of
material cal ed a thermoelectric. Alphabet Energy’s thermoelectric
material was developed over ten years by scientists at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratories.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
with many clean technology products, there are huge chal enges in
bringing a product like this to market. While working through its
leap-of-faith assumptions, Alphabet gured out early that developing a
solution for waste thermoelectricity required building a heat
exchanger and a generic device to transfer heat from one medium to
another as wel as doing project-speci c engineering. For instance, if
Alphabet wanted to build a solution for a utility such as Paci c Gas
and Electric, the heat exchanger would have to be con gured, shaped,
and instal ed to capture the heat from a power plant’s exhaust
system.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
makes Alphabet Energy unique is that the company made a savvy
decision early on in the research process. Instead of using
relatively rare elements as materials, they decided to base their
research on silicon wafers, the same physical substance that computer
central processing units (CPUs) are made from. As CEO</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Mat
hew Scul in explains, “Our thermoelectric is the only one that can
use low-cost semiconductor infrastructure for manufacturing.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	can
use low-cost semiconductor infrastructure for manufacturing.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
has enabled Alphabet Energy to design and build its products in smal
batches.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	By
contrast, most successful clean technology startups have had to make
substantial early investments. The solar panel provider SunPower had
to build in factories to manufacture its panels and partner with
instal ers before becoming ful y operational. Similarly, BrightSource
raised $291 mil ion to build and operate large-scale solar plants
without delivering a wat to a single customer.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead
of having to invest time and money in expensive fabrication
facilities, Alphabet is able to take advantage of the massive
existing infrastructure that produces silicon wafers for computer
electronics. As a result, Alphabet can go from a product concept to
holding a physical version in its hand in just six weeks from end to
end. Alphabet’s chal enge has been to nd the combination of
performance, price, and physical shape that is a match for early
customers. Although its technology has revolutionary potential, early
adopters wil deploy it only if they can see a clear return on
investment.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
might seem that the most obvious market for Alphabet’s technology
would be power plants, and indeed, that was the team’s initial
hypothesis. Alphabet hypothesized that simple cycle gas turbines
would be an ideal application; these turbines, which are similar to
jet engines strapped to the ground, are used by power generators to
provide energy for peak demand. Alphabet believed that at aching its
semiconductors to those turbines would be simple and cheap.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
company went about testing this hypothesis in smal batches by
building smal -scale solutions for its customers as a way of
learning. As with many initial ideas, their hypothesis was disproved
quickly. Power companies have a low tolerance for risk, making them
unlikely to become early adopters. Because it wasn’t weighed down
by a large-batch approach, Alphabet was ready to pivot after just
three months of investigation.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Alphabet
has eliminated many other potential markets as wel , leading to a
series of customer segment pivots. The company’s current e orts are
focused on manufacturing rms, which have the</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	current
e orts are focused on manufacturing rms, which have the ability to
experiment with new technologies in separate parts of their factory;
this al ows early adopters to evaluate the real-world bene ts before
commit ing to a larger deployment. These early deployments are put
ing more of Alphabet’s assumptions to the test. Unlike in the
computer hardware business, customers are not wil ing to pay top dol
ar for maximum performance. This has required signi cant changes in
Alphabet’s product, con guring it to achieve the lowest cost per
wat possible.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Al
this experimentation has cost the company a tiny fraction of what
other energy startups have consumed. To date, Alphabet has raised
approximately $1 mil ion. Only time wil tel if they wil prevail, but
thanks to the power of smal batches, they wil be able to discover the
truth much faster.10</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Toyota Production System is probably the most advanced system of
management in the world, but even more impressive is the fact that
Toyota has built the most advanced learning organization in history.
It has demonstrated an ability to unleash the creativity of its
employees, achieve consistent growth, and produce innovative new
products relentlessly over the course of nearly a century.11</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is the kind of long-term success to which entrepreneurs should
aspire. Although lean production techniques are powerful, they are
only a manifestation of a high-functioning organization that is
commit ed to achieving maximum performance by employing the right
measures of progress over the long term. Process is only the
foundation upon which a great company culture can develop. But
without this foundation, e orts to encourage learning, creativity,
and innovation wil fal at—as many disil usioned directors of HR</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Irecently
had two startups seek my advice on the same day. As types of
businesses, they could not have been more di erent. The rst is
developing a marketplace to help traders of col ectibles connect with
one another. These people are hard-core fans of movies, anime, or
comics who strive to put together complete col ections of toys and
other promotional merchandise related to the characters they love.
The startup aspires to compete with online marketplaces such as eBay
as wel as physical marketplaces at ached to conventions and other
gatherings of fans.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
second startup sel s database software to enterprise customers. They
have a next-generation database technology that can supplement or
replace o erings from large companies such as Oracle, IBM, and SAP.
Their customers are chief information of icers (CIOs), IT managers,
and engineers in some of the world’s largest organizations. These
are long-lead-time sales that require salespeople, sales engineering,
instal ation support, and maintenance contracts.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	You
could be forgiven for thinking these two companies have absolutely
nothing in common, yet both came to me with the exact same problem.
Each one had early customers and promising early revenue. They had
validated and invalidated many hypotheses in their business models
and were executing against their product road maps successful y.
Their customers had provided a healthy mix of positive feedback and
suggestions for improvements. Both companies had used their early
success to raise money from outside</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	companies
had used their early success to raise money from outside investors.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
problem was that neither company was growing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Both
CEOs brought me identical-looking graphs showing that their early
growth had atlined. They could not understand why.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
were acutely aware of the need to show progress to their employees
and investors and came to me because they wanted advice on how to
jump-start their growth. Should they invest in more advertising or
marketing programs? Should they focus on product quality or new
features? Should they try to improve conversion rates or pricing?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
it turns out, both companies share a deep similarity in the way their
businesses grow—and therefore a similar confusion about what to do.
Both are using the same engine of growth, the topic of this chapter.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	WHERE
DOES GROWTH COME FROM?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
engine of growth is the mechanism that startups use to achieve
sustainable growth. I use the word sustainable to exclude al one-time
activities that generate a surge of customers but have no long-term
impact, such as a single advertisement or a publicity stunt that
might be used to jump-start growth but could not sustain that growth
for the long term.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Sustainable
growth is characterized by one simple rule: New customers come from
the actions of past customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
are four primary ways past customers drive sustainable growth:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
Word of mouth. Embedded in most products is a natural level of growth
that is caused by satis ed customers’ enthusiasm for the product.
For example, when I bought my rst TiVo DVR, I couldn’t stop tel ing
my friends and family about it. Pret y soon, my entire family was
using one.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
As a side e ect of product usage. Fashion or status, such as luxury
goods products, drive awareness of themselves whenever they are used.
When you see someone dressed in the latest clothes or driving a
certain car, you may be in uenced to buy that product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is also true of so-cal ed viral products such as Facebook and PayPal.
When a customer sends money to a friend using PayPal, the friend is
exposed automatical y to the PayPal product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
Through funded advertising. Most businesses employ advertising to
entice new customers to use their products. For this to be a source
of sustainable growth, the advertising must be paid for out of
revenue, not one-time sources such as investment capital.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
long as the cost of acquiring a new customer (the so-cal ed marginal
cost) is less than the revenue that customer generates (the marginal
revenue), the excess (the marginal pro t) can be used to acquire more
customers. The more marginal pro t, the faster the growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	4.
Through repeat purchase or use. Some products are designed to be
purchased repeatedly either through a subscription plan (a cable
company) or through voluntary repurchases (groceries or lightbulbs).
By contrast, many products and services are intentional y designed as
one-time events, such as wedding planning.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
sources of sustainable growth power feedback loops that I have termed
engines of growth. Each is like a combustion engine, turning over and
over. The faster the loop turns, the faster the company wil grow.
Each engine has an intrinsic set of metrics that determine how fast a
company can grow when using it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>THE
THREE ENGINES OF GROWTH</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
saw in Part Two how important it is for startups to use the right
kind of metrics—actionable metrics—to evaluate their progress.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
this leaves a large amount of variety in terms of which numbers one
should measure. In fact, one of the most expensive forms of potential
waste for a startup is spending time arguing about how to prioritize
new development once it has a product on the market. At any time, the
company could invest its energy in nding new customers, servicing
existing customers bet er, improving overal quality, or driving down
costs. In my experience, the discussions about these kinds of
priority decisions can consume a substantial fraction of the
company’s time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Engines
of growth are designed to give startups a relatively smal set of
metrics on which to focus their energies. As one of my mentors, the
venture capital investor Shawn Carolan, put it,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Startups
don’t starve; they drown.” There are always a zil ion new ideas
about how to make the product bet er oating around, but the hard
truth is that most of those ideas make a di erence only at the
margins. They are mere optimizations. Startups have to focus on the
big experiments that lead to validated learning. The engines of
growth framework helps them stay focused on the metrics that mat er.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Sticky Engine of Growth</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
brings us back to the two startups that kicked o this chapter.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Both
are using the exact same engine of growth despite being in very di
erent industries. Both products are designed to at ract and retain
customers for the long term. The underlying mechanism of that
retention is di erent in the two cases. For the col ectible company,
the idea is to become the number one shopping destination for
fanatical col ectors. These are people who are constantly hunting for
the latest items and the best deals. If the company’s product works
as designed, col ectors who start using it wil check constantly and
repeatedly to see if new items are for sale as wel as listing their
own items for sale or trade.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	as
wel as listing their own items for sale or trade.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
startup database vendor relies on repeat usage for a very di erent
reason. Database technology is used only as the foundation for a
customer’s own products, such as a website or a point of sale
system. Once you build a product on top of a particular database
technology, it is extremely di cult to switch. In the IT industry,
such customers are said to be locked in to the vendor they choose.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
such a product to grow, it has to o er such a compel ing new
capability that customers are wil ing to risk being tied to a
proprietary vendor for a potential y long time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Thus,
both businesses rely on having a high customer retention rate. They
have an expectation that once you start using their product, you wil
continue to do so. This is the same dynamic as a mobile telephone
service provider: when a customer cancels his or her service, it
general y means that he or she is extremely dissatis ed or is
switching to a competitor’s product. This is in contrast to, say,
groceries on a store aisle. In the grocery retail business, customer
tastes uctuate, and if a customer buys a Pepsi this week instead of
Coke, it’s not necessarily a big deal.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Therefore,
companies using the sticky engine of growth track their at rition
rate or churn rate very careful y. The churn rate is de ned as the
fraction of customers in any period who fail to remain engaged with
the company’s product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
rules that govern the sticky engine of growth are pret y simple: if
the rate of new customer acquisition exceeds the churn rate, the
product wil grow. The speed of growth is determined by what I cal the
rate of compounding, which is simply the natural growth rate minus
the churn rate. Like a bank account that earns compounding interest,
having a high rate of compounding wil lead to extremely rapid
growth—without advertising, viral growth, or publicity stunts.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
both of these sticky startups were tracking their progress using
generic indicators such as the total number of customers. Even the
actionable metrics they were using, such as the activation rate and
revenue per customer, weren’t very helpful because in the sticky
engine of growth, these variables have lit le impact on growth. (In
the sticky engine of growth, they are bet er</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	impact
on growth. (In the sticky engine of growth, they are bet er suited to
testing the value hypothesis that was discussed in Chapter 5.)After
our meeting, one of the two startups took me up on my advice to model
its customer behavior by using the sticky engine of growth as a
template. The results were striking: a 61 percent retention rate and
a 39 percent growth rate of new customers. In other words, its churn
rate and new customer acquisition balanced each other almost
perfectly, leading to a compounding growth rate of just 0.02
percent—almost zero.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is typical for companies in an engagement business that are
struggling to nd growth. An insider who worked at the dot-com-era
company PointCast once showed me how that company su ered a similar
dysfunction. When PointCast was struggling to grow, it was
nonetheless incredibly successful in new customer acquisition—just
like this sticky startup (39 percent every period).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
this growth is being o set by an equivalent amount of churn. Once it
is modeled this way, the good news should be apparent: there are
plenty of new customers coming in the door.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
way to nd growth is to focus on existing customers for the product
even more engaging to them. For example, the company could focus on
get ing more and bet er listings. This would create an incentive for
customers to check back often. Alternatively, the company could do
something more direct such as messaging them about limited-time sales
or special of ers. Either way, its focus needs to be on improving
customer retention. This goes against the standard intuition in that
if a company lacks growth, it should invest more in sales and
marketing. This counterintuitive result is hard to infer from
standard vanity metrics.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Viral Engine of Growth</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Online
social networks and Tupperware are examples of products for which
customers do the lion’s share of the marketing. Awareness of the
product spreads rapidly from person to person similarly to the way a
virus becomes an epidemic. This is distinct from the</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	the
way a virus becomes an epidemic. This is distinct from the simple
word-of-mouth growth discussed above. Instead, products that exhibit
viral growth depend on person-to-person transmission as a necessary
consequence of normal product use. Customers are not intentional y
acting as evangelists; they are not necessarily trying to spread the
word about the product. Growth happens automatical y as a side e ect
of customers using the product.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Viruses
are not optional.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, one of the most famous viral success stories is a company
cal ed Hotmail. In 1996, Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith launched a new
web-based e-mail service that o ered customers free accounts. At rst,
growth was sluggish; with only a smal seed investment from the
venture capital rm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the Hotmail team could
not a ord an extensive marketing campaign. But everything changed
when they made one smal tweak to the product. They added to the bot
om of every single email the message “P.S. Get your free e-mail at
Hotmail” along with a clickable link.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Within
weeks, that smal product change produced massive results. Within six
months, Bhatia and Smith had signed up more than 1 mil ion new
customers. Five weeks later, they hit the 2</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	mil
ion mark. Eighteen months after launching the service, with 12</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	and
its speed is determined by a single mathematical term cal ed the
viral coe cient. The higher this coe cient is, the faster the product
wil spread. The viral coe cient measures how many new customers wil
use a product as a consequence of each new customer who signs up. Put
another way, how many friends wil each customer bring with him or
her? Since each friend is also a new customer, he or she has an
opportunity to recruit yet more friends.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
a product with a viral coe cient of 0.1, one in every ten customers
wil recruit one of his or her friends. This is not a sustainable
loop. Imagine that one hundred customers sign up. They wil cause ten
friends to sign up. Those ten friends wil cause one additional person
to sign up, but there the loop wil fizzle out.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	By
contrast, a viral loop with a coe cient that is greater than 1.0</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	wil

average, more than one other person with him or her.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	increasing
the viral coe cient more than anything else, because even tiny
changes in this number wil cause dramatic changes in their future
prospects.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
consequence of this is that many viral products do not charge
customers directly but rely on indirect sources of revenue such as
advertising. This is the case because viral products cannot a ord to
have any friction impede the process of signing customers up and
recruiting their friends. This can make testing the value hypothesis
for viral products especial y chal enging.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
true test of the value hypothesis is always a voluntary exchange of
value between customers and the startup that serves them. A lot of
confusion stems from the fact that this exchange can be monetary, as
in the case of Tupperware, or nonmonetary, as in the case of
Facebook. In the viral engine of growth, monetary exchange does not
drive new growth; it is useful only as an indicator that customers
value the product enough to pay for it. If Facebook or Hotmail had
started charging customers in their early days, it would have been
foolish, as it would have impeded their ability to grow. However, it
is not true that customers do not give these companies something of
value: by investing their time and at ention in the product, they
make the product valuable to advertisers. Companies that sel
advertising actual y serve two di erent groups of customers—consumers
and advertisers—and exchange a dif erent currency of value with
each.2</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is markedly di erent from companies that actively use money to fuel
their expansion, such as a retail chain that can grow as fast as it
can fund the opening of new stores at suitable locations.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	These
companies are using a dif erent engine of growth altogether.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Paid Engine of Growth</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Imagine
another pair of businesses. The rst makes $1 on each customer it
signs up; the second makes $100,000 from each customer it signs up.
To predict which company wil grow faster, you need to know only one
additional thing: how much it costs to sign up a new customer.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	sign
up a new customer.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Imagine
that the rst company uses Google AdWords to nd new customers online
and pays an average of 80 cents each time a new customer joins. The
second company sel s heavy goods to large companies. Each sale
requires a signi cant time investment from a salesperson and on-site
sales engineering to help instal the product; these hard costs total
up to $80,000 per new customer. Both companies wil grow at the exact
same rate. Each has the same proportion of revenue (20 percent)
available to reinvest in new customer acquisition. If either company
wants to increase its rate of growth, it can do so in one of two
ways: increase the revenue from each customer or drive down the cost
of acquiring a new customer.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	That’s
the paid engine of growth at work.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
relating the IMVU story in Chapter 3, I talked about how we made a
major early mistake in set ing up the IMVU strategy. We ultimately
wound up having to make an engine of growth pivot.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
original y thought that our IM add-on strategy would al ow the
product to grow viral y. Unfortunately, customers refused to go along
with our bril iant strategy.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Our
basic misconception was a belief that customers would be wil ing to
use IMVU as an add-on to existing instant messaging networks. We
believed that the product would spread viral y through those
networks, passed from customer to customer. The problem with that
theory is that some kinds of products are not compatible with viral
growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	IMVU’s
customers didn’t want to use the product with their existing
friends. They wanted to use it to make new friends.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
that meant they did not have a strong incentive to bring new
customers to the product; they viewed that as our job.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Fortunately,
IMVU was able to grow by using paid advertising because our customers
were wil ing to pay more for our product than it cost us to reach
them via advertising.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Like
the other engines, the paid engine of growth is powered by a feedback
loop. Each customer pays a certain amount of money for the product
over his or her “lifetime” as a customer. Once variable costs are
deducted, this usual y is cal ed the customer lifetime value (LTV).
This revenue can be invested in growth by buying</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	(LTV).
This revenue can be invested in growth by buying advertising.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Suppose
an advertisement costs $100 and causes fty new customers to sign up
for the service. This ad has a cost per acquisition (CPA) of $2.00.
In this example, if the product has an LTV that is greater than $2,
the product wil grow. The margin between the LTV and the CPA
determines how fast the paid engine of growth wil turn (this is cal
ed the marginal pro t). Conversely, if the CPA remains at $2.00 but
the LTV fal s below $2.00, the company’s growth wil slow. It may
make up the di erence with one-time tactics such as using invested
capital or publicity stunts, but those tactics are not sustainable.
This was the fate of many failed companies, including notable dot-com
ameouts that erroneously believed that they could lose money on each
customer but, as the old joke goes, make it up in volume.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Although
I have explained the paid engine of growth in terms of advertising,
it is far broader than that. Startups that employ an outbound sales
force are also using this engine, as are retail companies that rely
on foot tra c. Al these costs should be factored into the cost per
acquisition.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, one startup I worked with built col aboration tools for
teams and groups. It went through a radical pivot, switching from a
tool that was used primarily by hobbyists and smal clubs to one that
was sold primarily to enterprises, nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), and other extremely large organizations.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
they made that customer segment pivot without changing their engine
of growth. Previously, they had done customer acquisition online,
using web-based direct marketing techniques. I remember one early
situation in which the company elded a cal from a major NGO that
wanted to buy its product and rol it out across many divisions. The
startup had an “unlimited” pricing plan, its most expensive, that
cost only a few hundred dol ars per month.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
NGO literal y could not make the purchase because it had no process
in place for buying something so inexpensive. Additional y, the NGO
needed substantial help in managing the rol out, educating its sta on
the new tool, and tracking the impact of the change; those were al
services the company was il equipped to o er.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	those
were al services the company was il equipped to o er.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Changing
customer segments required them to switch to hiring a sizable
outbound sales sta that spent time at ending conferences, educating
executives, and authoring white papers. Those much higher costs came
with a corresponding reward: the company switched from making only a
few dol ars per customer to making tens and then hundreds of
thousands of dol ars per much larger customer. Their new engine of
growth led to sustained success.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
sources of customer acquisition are subject to competition.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, prime retail storefronts have more foot tra c and are
therefore more valuable. Similarly, advertising that is targeted to
more a uent customers general y costs more than advertising that
reaches the general public. What determines these prices is the
average value earned in aggregate by the companies that are in
competition for any given customer’s at ention. Wealthy consumers
cost more to reach because they tend to become more pro table
customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Over
time, any source of customer acquisition wil tend to have its CPA bid
up by this competition. If everyone in an industry makes the same
amount of money on each sale, they al wil wind up paying most of
their marginal pro t to the source of acquisition.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Thus,
the ability to grow in the long term by using the paid engine
requires a di erentiated ability to monetize a certain set of
customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	IMVU
is a case in point. Our customers were not considered very lucrative
by other online services: they included a lot of teenagers,
low-income adults, and international customers. Other services tended
to assume those people would not pay for anything online.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	At
IMVU, we developed techniques for col ecting online payments from
customers who did not have a credit card, such as al owing them to
bil to their mobile phones or send us cash in the mail.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Therefore,
we could a ord to pay more to acquire those customers than our
competitors could.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
Technical Caveat</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Technical
y, more than one engine of growth can operate in a business at a
time. For example, there are products that have extremely fast viral
growth as wel as extremely low customer churn rates. Also, there is
no reason why a product cannot have both high margins and high
retention. However, in my experience, successful startups usual y
focus on just one engine of growth, specializing in everything that
is required to make it work.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Companies
that at empt to build a dashboard that includes al three engines tend
to cause a lot of confusion because the operations expertise required
to model al these e ects simultaneously is quite complicated.
Therefore, I strongly recommend that startups focus on one engine at
a time. Most entrepreneurs already have a strong leap-of-faith
hypothesis about which engine is most likely to work.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
they do not, time spent out of the building with customers wil
quickly suggest one that seems pro table. Only after pursuing one
engine thoroughly should a startup consider a pivot to one of the
others.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	ENGINES
OF GROWTH DETERMINE PRODUCT/MARKET FIT</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Marc
Andreessen, the legendary entrepreneur and investor and one of the
fathers of the World Wide Web, coined the term product/market t to
describe the moment when a startup nal y finds a widespread set of
customers that resonate with its product: In a great market—a
market with lots of real potential customers—the market pul s
product out of the startup.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When

ege campuses practical y overnight, or Lotus taking the business
world by storm, sel ing $54 mil ion worth of Lotus 1-2-3 in its first
year of operation.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Startups
occasional y ask me to help them evaluate whether they have achieved
product/market t. It’s easy to answer: if you are asking, you’re
not there yet. Unfortunately, this doesn’t help companies gure out
how to get closer to product/market t. How can you tel if you are on
the verge of success or hopelessly far away?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Although
I don’t think Andreessen intended this as part of his de nition, to
many entrepreneurs it implies that a pivot is a failure event—“our
startup has failed to achieve product/market t.” It also implies
the inverse—that once our product has achieved product/market t, we
won’t have to pivot anymore. Both assumptions are wrong.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
believe the concept of the engine of growth can put the idea of
product/market t on a more rigorous footing. Since each engine of
growth can be de ned quantitatively, each has a unique set of metrics
that can be used to evaluate whether a startup is on the verge of
achieving product/market t. A startup with a viral coe cient of 0.9
or more is on the verge of success. Even bet er, the metrics for each
engine of growth work in tandem with the innovation accounting model
discussed in Chapter 7 to give direction to a startup’s product
development e orts. For example, if a startup is at empting to use
the viral engine of growth, it can focus its development e orts on
things that might a ect customer behavior—on the viral loop—and
safely ignore those that do not.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Such
a startup does not need to specialize in marketing, advertising, or
sales functions. Conversely, a company using the paid engine needs to
develop those marketing and sales functions urgently.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
startup can evaluate whether it is get ing closer to product/market t
as it tunes its engine by evaluating each trip through the
Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop using innovation accounting. What
real y mat ers is not the raw numbers or vanity metrics but the
direction and degree of progress.</p>

but what if each company’s innovation accounting dashboard looks

Every engine is tied to a given set of customers and their related
habits, preferences, advertising channels, and interconnections. At
some point, that set of customers wil be exhausted. This may take a
long time or a short time, depending on one’s industry and timing.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Chapter
6 emphasized the importance of building the minimum viable product in
such a way that it contains no additional features beyond what is
required by early adopters. Fol owing that strategy successful y wil
unlock an engine of growth that can reach that target audience.
However, making the transition to mainstream customers wil require
tremendous additional work.4 Once we have a product that is growing
among early adopters, we could in theory stop work in product
development entirely. The product would continue to grow until it
reached the limits of that early market.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Then
growth would level o or even stop completely. The chal enge comes
from the fact that this slowdown might take months or even years to

unfortunate companies wind up fol owing this strategy inadvertently.
Because they are using vanity metrics and traditional accounting,
they think they are making progress when they see their numbers
growing. They falsely believe they are making their product bet er
when in fact they are having no impact on customer behavior. The
growth is al coming from an engine of growth that is working—running
e ciently to bring in new customers—not from improvements driven by
product development. Thus, when the growth suddenly slows, it

al the various kinds of problems that could occur wound up delaying
the company from put ing out any product. I’ve seen companies fail
the other way from the so-cal ed Friendster e ect, su ering a
high-pro le technical failure just when customer adoption is going
wild. As a department executive, this outcome is worst of al ,
because the failure is both high-pro le and at ributable to a single
function or department—yours. Not only wil the company fail, it wil
be your fault.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
of the advice I’ve heard on this topic has suggested a kind of
split-the-di erence approach (as in, “engage in a lit le planning,
but not too much”). The problem with this wil y-nil y approach is
that it’s hard to give any rationale for why we should anticipate
one particular problem but ignore another. It can feel like the boss
is being capricious or arbitrary, and that feeds the common feeling
that management’s decisions conceal an ulterior motive.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
those being managed this way, their incentives are clear. If the boss
tends to split the di erence, the best way to in uence the boss and
get what you want is to take the most extreme position possible. For
example, if one group is advocating for an extremely lengthy release
cycle, say, an annual new product introduction, you might choose to
argue for an equal y extremely short release cycle (perhaps weekly or
even daily), knowing that the two opinions wil be averaged out. Then,
when the di erence is split, you’re likely to get an outcome closer
to what you actual y wanted in the rst place. Unfortunately, this
kind of arms race escalates. Rivals in another camp are likely to do
the same thing. Over time, everyone wil take the most polarized
positions possible, which makes split ing the di erence ever more di
cult and ever less successful.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Managers
have to take responsibility for knowingly or inadvertently creating
such incentives. Although it was not their intention to reward
extreme polarization, that’s exactly what they are doing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	reward
extreme polarization, that’s exactly what they are doing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Get
ing out of this trap requires a significant shift in thinking.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>BUILDING
AN ADAPTIVE ORGANIZATION</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Should
a startup invest in a training program for new employees? If you had
asked me a few years ago, I would have laughed and said,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Absolutely
not. Training programs are for big companies that can a ord them.”
Yet at IMVU we wound up building a training program that was so good,
new hires were productive on their rst day of employment. Within just
a few weeks, those employees were contributing at a high level. It
required a huge e ort to standardize our work processes and prepare a
curriculum of the concepts that new employees should learn. Every new
engineer would be assigned a mentor, who would help the new employee
work through a curriculum of systems, concepts, and techniques he or
she would need to become productive at IMVU. The performance of the
mentor and mentee were linked, so the mentors took this education
seriously.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
is interesting, looking back at this example, is that we never
stopped work and decided that we needed to build a great training
program. Instead, the training program evolved organical y out of a
methodical approach to evolving our own process. This process of
orientation was subject to constant experimentation and revision so
that it grew more ef ective—and less burdensome—over time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
cal this building an adaptive organization, one that automatical y
adjusts its process and performance to current conditions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Can
You Go Too Fast?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	So
far this book has emphasized the importance of speed. Startups are in
a life-or-death struggle to learn how to build a sustainable business
before they run out of resources and die. However, focusing on speed
alone would be destructive. To work, startups</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	focusing
on speed alone would be destructive. To work, startups require
built-in speed regulators that help teams nd their optimal pace of
work.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
saw an example of speed regulation in Chapter 9 with the use of the
andon cord in systems such as continuous deployment. It is epitomized
in the paradoxical Toyota proverb, “Stop production so that
production never has to stop.” The key to the andon cord is that it
brings work to a stop as soon as an uncorrectable quality problem
surfaces—which forces it to be investigated. This is one of the
most important discoveries of the lean manufacturing movement: you
cannot trade quality for time. If you are causing (or missing)
quality problems now, the resulting defects wil slow you down later.
Defects cause a lot of rework, low morale, and customer complaints,
al of which slow progress and eat away at valuable resources.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	So
far I have used the language of physical products to describe these
problems, but that is simply a mat er of convenience. Service
businesses have the same chal enges. Just ask any manager of a
training, sta ng, or hospitality rm to show you the playbook that
speci es how employees are supposed to deliver the service under
various conditions. What might have started out as a simple guide
tends to grow inexorably over time. Pret y soon, orientation is
incredibly complex and employees have invested a lot of time and
energy in learning the rules. Now consider an entrepreneurial manager
in that kind of company trying to experiment with new rules or
procedures. The higher-quality the existing playbook is, the easier
it wil be for it to evolve over time. By contrast, a low-quality
playbook wil be l ed with contradictory or ambiguous rules that cause
confusion when anything is changed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
I teach the Lean Startup approach to entrepreneurs with an
engineering background, this is one of the hardest concepts to grasp.
On the one hand, the logic of validated learning and the minimum
viable product says that we should get a product into customers’
hands as soon as possible and that any extra work we do beyond what
is required to learn from customers is waste. On the other hand, the
Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop is a continuous process. We don’t
stop after one minimum viable product but use</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	process.
We don’t stop after one minimum viable product but use what we have
learned to get to work immediately on the next iteration.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Therefore,
shortcuts taken in product quality, design, or infrastructure today
may wind up slowing a company down tomorrow. You can see this paradox
in action at IMVU. Chapter 3</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	recounted
how we wound up shipping a product to customers that was ful of bugs,
missing features, and bad design. The customers wouldn’t even try
that product, and so most of that work had to be thrown away. It’s
a good thing we didn’t waste a lot of time xing those bugs and
cleaning up that early version.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
as our learning al owed us to build products that customers did want,
we faced slowdowns. Having a low-quality product can inhibit learning
when the defects prevent customers from experiencing (and giving
feedback on) the product’s bene ts.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
IMVU’s case, as we o ered the product to more mainstream customers,
they were much less forgiving than early adopters had been.
Similarly, the more features we added to the product, the harder it
became to add even more because of the risk that a new feature would
interfere with an existing feature. The same dynamics happen in a
service business, since any new rules may con ict with existing
rules, and the more rules, the more possibilities for conflict.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	IMVU
used the techniques of this chapter to achieve scale and quality in a
just-in-time fashion.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	THE
WISDOM OF THE FIVE WHYS</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
accelerate, Lean Startups need a process that provides a natural
feedback loop. When you’re going too fast, you cause more problems.
Adaptive processes force you to slow down and invest in preventing
the kinds of problems that are currently wasting time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
those preventive ef orts pay of , you natural y speed up again.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Let’s
return to the question of having a training program for new
employees. Without a program, new employees wil make mistakes while
in their learning curve that wil require assistance and intervention
from other team members, slowing everyone down.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	intervention
from other team members, slowing everyone down.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	How
do you decide if the investment in training is worth the bene t of
speed due to reduced interruptions? Figuring this out from a top-down
perspective is chal enging, because it requires estimating two
completely unknown quantities: how much it wil cost to build an
unknown program against an unknown bene t you might reap. Even worse,
the traditional way to make these kinds of decisions is decidedly
large-batch thinking. A company either has an elaborate training
program or it does not. Until they can justify the return on
investment from building a ful program, most companies general y do
nothing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
alternative is to use a system cal ed the Five Whys to make
incremental investments and evolve a startup’s processes gradual y.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
core idea of Five Whys is to tie investments directly to the
prevention of the most problematic symptoms. The system takes its
name from the investigative method of asking the question “Why?”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	ve
times to understand what has happened (the root cause). If you’ve
ever had to answer a precocious child who wants to know</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Why
is the sky blue?” and keeps asking “Why?” after each answer,
you’re familiar with it. This technique was developed as a
systematic problem-solving tool by Tai chi Ohno, the father of the
Toyota Production System. I have adapted it for use in the Lean
Startup model with a few changes designed specifical y for startups.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	At
the root of every seemingly technical problem is a human problem.
Five Whys provides an opportunity to discover what that human problem
might be. Tai chi Ohno gives the fol owing example:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
confronted with a problem, have you ever stopped and asked why ve
times? It is di cult to do even though it sounds easy. For example,
suppose a machine stopped functioning:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
Why did the machine stop? (There was an overload and the fuse blew.)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
Why was there an overload? (The bearing was not su ciently
lubricated.)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	lubricated.)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
Why was it not lubricated su ciently? (The lubrication pump was not
pumping suf iciently.)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	4.
Why was it not pumping su ciently? (The shaft of the pump was worn
and rat ling.)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	5.
Why was the shaft worn out? (There was no strainer at ached and metal
scrap got in.)</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Repeating
“why” ve times, like this, can help uncover the root problem and
correct it. If this procedure were not carried through, one might
simply replace the fuse or the pump shaft. In that case, the problem
would recur within a few months. The Toyota production system has
been built on the practice and evolution of this scienti c approach.
By asking and answering “why” ve times, we can get to the real
cause of the problem, which is often hidden behind more obvious
symptoms.1</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Note
that even in Ohno’s relatively simple example the root cause moves
away from a technical fault (a blown fuse) and toward a human error
(someone forgot to at ach a strainer). This is completely typical of
most problems that startups face no mat er what industry they are in.
Going back to our service business example, most problems that at rst
appear to be individual mistakes can be traced back to problems in
training or the original playbook for how the service is to be
delivered.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Let
me demonstrate how using the Five Whys al owed us to build the
employee training system that was mentioned earlier. Imagine that at
IMVU we suddenly start receiving complaints from customers about a
new version of the product that we have just released.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
A new release disabled a feature for customers. Why? Because a
particular server failed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
Why did the server fail? Because an obscure subsystem was used in the
wrong way.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	used
in the wrong way.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
Why was it used in the wrong way? The engineer who used it didn’t
know how to use it properly.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	4.
Why didn’t he know? Because he was never trained.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	5.
Why wasn’t he trained? Because his manager doesn’t believe in
training new engineers because he and his team are “too busy.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
began as a purely technical fault is revealed quickly to be a very
human managerial issue.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Make
a Proportional Investment</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Here’s
how to use Five Whys analysis to build an adaptive organization:
consistently make a proportional investment at each of the ve levels
of the hierarchy. In other words, the investment should be smal er
when the symptom is minor and larger when the symptom is more
painful. We don’t make large investments in prevention unless we’re
coping with large problems.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
the example above, the answer is to x the server, change the
subsystem to make it less error-prone, educate the engineer, and,
yes, have a conversation with the engineer’s manager.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
lat er piece, the conversation with the manager, is always hard,
especial y in a startup. When I was a startup manager, if you told me
I needed to invest in training my people, I would have told you it
was a waste of time. There were always too many other things to do.
I’d probably have said something sarcastic like “Sure, I’d be
happy to do that—if you can spare my time for the eight weeks it’l
take to set up.” That’s manager-speak for “No way in hel .”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	That’s
why the proportional investment approach is so important. If the
outage is a minor glitch, it’s essential that we make only a minor
investment in xing it. Let’s do the rst hour of the eight-week
plan. That may not sound like much, but it’s a start.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
the problem recurs, asking the Five Whys wil require that we continue
to make progress on it. If the problem does not occur again, an hour
isn’t a big loss.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	again,
an hour isn’t a big loss.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
used the example of engineering training because that was something I
was reluctant to invest in at IMVU. At the outset of our venture, I
thought we needed to focus al of our energies on building and
marketing our product. Yet once we entered a period of rapid hiring,
repeated Five Whys sessions revealed that problems caused by lack of
training were slowing down product development. At no point did we
drop everything to focus solely on training. Instead, we made
incremental improvements to the process constantly, each time reaping
incremental bene ts. Over time, those changes compounded, freeing up
time and energy that previously had been lost to firefighting and
crisis management.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Automatic
Speed Regulator</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Five Whys approach acts as a natural speed regulator. The more
problems you have, the more you invest in solutions to those
problems. As the investments in infrastructure or process pay o , the
severity and number of crises are reduced and the team speeds up
again. With startups in particular, there is a danger that teams wil
work too fast, trading quality for time in a way that causes sloppy
mistakes. Five Whys prevents that, al owing teams to nd their optimal
pace.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Five Whys ties the rate of progress to learning, not just execution.
Startup teams should go through the Five Whys whenever they encounter
any kind of failure, including technical faults, failures to achieve
business results, or unexpected changes in customer behavior.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Five
Whys is a powerful organizational technique. Some of the engineers I
have trained to use it believe that you can derive al the other Lean
Startup techniques from the Five Whys. Coupled with working in smal
batches, it provides the foundation a company needs to respond
quickly to problems as they appear, without overinvesting or
overengineering.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	THE
CURSE OF THE FIVE BLAMES</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
teams rst adopt Five Whys as a problem-solving tool, they encounter
some common pitfal s. We need systems like Five Whys to overcome our
psychological limitations because we tend to overreact to what’s
happening in the moment. We also tend to get frustrated if things
happen that we did not anticipate.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
the Five Whys approach goes awry, I cal it the Five Blames. Instead
of asking why repeatedly in an at empt to understand what went wrong,
frustrated teammates start pointing ngers at each other, trying to
decide who is at fault. Instead of using the Five Whys to nd and x
problems, managers and employees can fal into the trap of using the
Five Blames as a means for venting their frustrations and cal ing out
col eagues for systemic failures. Although it’s human nature to
assume that when we see a mistake, it’s due to defects in someone
else’s department, knowledge, or character, the goal of the Five
Whys is to help us see the objective truth that chronic problems are
caused by bad process, not bad people, and remedy them accordingly.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
recommend several tactics for escaping the Five Blames. The rst is to
make sure that everyone a ected by the problem is in the room during
the analysis of the root cause. The meeting should include anyone who
discovered or diagnosed the problem, including customer service
representatives who elded the cal s, if possible. It should include
anyone who tried to x the symptom as wel as anyone who worked on the
subsystems or features involved.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
the problem was escalated to senior management, the decision makers
who were involved in the escalation should be present as wel .</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
may make for a crowded room, but it’s essential. In my experience,
whoever is left out of the discussion ends up being the target for
blame. This is just as damaging whether the scapegoat is a junior
employee or the CEO. When it’s a junior employee, it’s al too
easy to believe that that person is replaceable. If the CEO is not
present, it’s al too easy to assume that his or her behavior is
unchangeable. Neither presumption is usual y correct.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	unchangeable.
Neither presumption is usual y correct.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
blame inevitably arises, the most senior people in the room should
repeat this mantra: if a mistake happens, shame on us for making it
so easy to make that mistake. In a Five Whys analysis, we want to
have a systems-level view as much as possible.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Here’s
a situation in which this mantra came in handy. Because of the
training process we had developed at IMVU through the Five Whys, we
routinely asked new engineers to make a change to the production
environment on their rst day. For engineers trained in traditional
development methods, this was often frightening. They would ask,
“What wil happen to me if I accidental y disrupt or stop the
production process?” In their previous jobs, that was a mistake
that could get them red. At IMVU we told new hires, “If our
production process is so fragile that you can break it on your very
rst day of work, shame on us for making it so easy to do so.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
they did manage to break it, we immediately would have them lead the
e ort to x the problem as wel as the e ort to prevent the next person
from repeating their mistake.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
new hires who came from companies with a very di erent culture, this
was often a stressful initiation, but everyone came through it with a
visceral understanding of our values. Bit by bit, system by system,
those smal investments added up to a robust product development
process that al owed al our employees to work more creatively, with
greatly reduced fear.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Get
ing Started</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Here
are a few tips on how to get started with the Five Whys that are
based on my experience introducing this technique at many other
companies.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
the Five Whys to work properly, there are rules that must be fol
owed. For example, the Five Whys requires an environment of mutual
trust and empowerment. In situations in which this is lacking, the
complexity of Five Whys can be overwhelming. In such situations, I’ve
often used a simplified version that stil al ows teams to focus on
analyzing root causes while developing the muscles</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	to
focus on analyzing root causes while developing the muscles they’l
need later to tackle the ful -blown method.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
ask teams to adopt these simple rules:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
Be tolerant of al mistakes the first time.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
Never al ow the same mistake to be made twice.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
rst rule encourages people to get used to being compassionate about
mistakes, especial y the mistakes of others.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Remember,
most mistakes are caused by awed systems, not bad people. The second
rule gets the team started making proportional investments in
prevention.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
simpli ed system works wel . In fact, we used it at IMVU in the days
before I discovered the Five Whys and the Toyota Production System.
However, such a simpli ed system does not work e ectively over the
long term, as I found out rsthand. In fact, that was one of the
things that drove me to rst learn about lean production.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
strength and weakness of the simpli ed system is that it invites
questions such as What counts as the same problem? What kinds of
mistakes should we focus on? and Should we x this individual problem
or try to prevent a whole category of related problems? For a team
that is just get ing started, these questions are thought-provoking
and can lay the groundwork for more elaborate methods to come.
Ultimately, though, they do need answering.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
need a complete adaptive process such as the Five Whys.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Facing
Unpleasant Truths</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	You
wil need to be prepared for the fact that Five Whys is going to turn
up unpleasant facts about your organization, especial y at the
beginning. It is going to cal for investments in prevention that come
at the expense of time and money that could be invested in new
products or features. Under pressure, teams may feel that they don’t
have time to waste on analyzing root causes even though it would give
them more time in the long term. The process</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	would
give them more time in the long term. The process sometimes wil
devolve into the Five Blames. At al these junctures, it is essential
that someone with su cient authority be present to insist that the
process be fol owed, that its recommendations be implemented, and to
act as a referee if disagreements are up.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Building
an adaptive organization, in other words, requires executive
leadership to sponsor and support the process.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Often,
individual contributors at startups come to my workshops, eager to
get started with the Five Whys. I caution against at empting to do
that if they do not have the buy-in of the manager or team leader.
Proceed cautiously if you nd yourself in this situation. It may not
be possible to get the entire team together for a true Five Whys
inquiry, but you can always fol ow the simple two-rule version in
your own work. Whenever something goes wrong, ask yourself: How could
I prevent myself from being in this situation ever again?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Start
Smal , Be Specific</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Once
you are ready to begin, I recommend starting with a narrowly targeted
class of symptoms. For example, the rst time I used the Five Whys
successful y, I used it to diagnose problems with one of our internal
testing tools that did not a ect customers directly. It may be
tempting to start with something large and important because that is
where most of the time is being wasted as a result of a awed process,
but it is also where the pressure wil be greatest.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
the stakes are high, the Five Whys can devolve into the Five Blames
quickly. It’s bet er to give the team a chance to learn how to do
the process first and then expand into higher-stakes areas later.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
more speci c the symptoms are, the easier it wil be for everyone to
recognize when it’s time to schedule a Five Whys meeting. Say you
want to use the Five Whys to address bil ing complaints from
customers. In that case, pick a date after which al bil ing
complaints wil trigger a Five Whys meeting automatical y.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Note
that this requires that there be a smal enough volume of complaints
that having this meeting every time one comes in is</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	complaints
that having this meeting every time one comes in is practical. If
there are already too many complaints, pick a subset on which you
want to focus. Make sure that the rule that determines which kinds of
complaints trigger a Five Whys meeting is simple and ironclad. For
example, you might decide that every complaint involving a credit
card transaction wil be investigated. That’s an easy rule to fol
ow. Don’t pick a rule that is ambiguous.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	At
rst, the temptation may be to make radical and deep changes to every
bil ing system and process. Don’t. Instead, keep the meetings short
and pick relatively simple changes at each of the ve levels of the
inquiry. Over time, as the team gets more comfortable with the
process, you can expand it to include more and more types of bil ing
complaints and then to other kinds of problems.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Appoint
a Five Whys Master</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
facilitate learning, I have found it helpful to appoint a Five Whys
master for each area in which the method is being used. This
individual is tasked with being the moderator for each Five Whys
meeting, making decisions about which prevention steps to take, and
assigning the fol ow-up work from that meeting. The master must be
senior enough to have the authority to ensure that those assignments
get done but should not be so senior that he or she wil not be able
to be present at the meetings because of con icting responsibilities.
The Five Whys master is the point person in terms of accountability;
he or she is the primary change agent. People in this position can
assess how wel the meetings are going and whether the prevention
investments that are being made are paying of .</p>

FIVE WHYS IN ACTION</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	IGN
Entertainment, a division of News Corporation, is an online video
games media company with the biggest audience of video</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	video
games media company with the biggest audience of video game players
in the world. More than 45 mil ion gamers frequent its portfolio of
media properties. IGN was founded in the late 1990s, and News
Corporation acquired it in 2005. IGN has grown to employ several
hundred people, including almost a hundred engineers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Recently,
I had the opportunity to speak to the product development team at
IGN. They had been successful in recent years, but like al the
established companies we’ve seen throughout this book, they were
looking to accelerate new product development and nd ways to be more
innovative. They brought together their engineering, product, and
design teams to talk through ways they could apply the Lean Startup
model.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
change initiative had the support of IGN’s senior management,
including the CEO, the head of product development, the vice
president of engineering, the publisher, and the head of product.
Their previous ef orts at Five Whys had not gone smoothly.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
had at empted to tackle a laundry list of problem areas nominated by
the product team. The issues varied from discrepancies in web
analytics to partner data feeds that were not working. Their rst Five
Whys meeting took an hour, and although they came up with some
interesting takeaways, as far as the Five Whys goes, it was a
disaster. None of the people who were connected to and knew the most
about the issues were at the meeting, and because this was the rst
time they were doing the Five Whys together, they didn’t stick to
the format and went o on many tangents. It wasn’t a complete waste
of time, but it didn’t have any of the bene ts of the adaptive
style of management discussed in this chapter.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Don’t
Send Your Baggage through the Five Whys Process IGN had the
experience of trying to solve al of its “baggage” issues that had
been causing wasted time for many years. Because this is an
overwhelming set of problems, nding xes quickly proves overwhelming.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	overwhelming.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
their zeal to get started with the Five Whys, IGN neglected three
important things:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
To introduce Five Whys to an organization, it is necessary to hold
Five Whys sessions as new problems come up. Since baggage issues are
endemic, they natural y come up as part of the Five Whys analysis and
you can take that opportunity to x them incremental y. If they don’t
come up organical y, maybe they’re not as big as they seem.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
Everyone who is connected to a problem needs to be at the Five Whys
session. Many organizations face the temptation to save time by
sparing busy people from the root cause analysis.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is a false economy, as IGN discovered the hard way.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
At the beginning of each Five Whys session, take a few minutes to
explain what the process is for and how it works for the bene t of
those who are new to it. If possible, use an example of a successful
Five Whys session from the past. If you’re brand new, you can use
my earlier example about the manager who doesn’t believe in
training. IGN learned that, whenever possible, it helps to use
something that has personal meaning for the team.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	After
our meeting, the IGN leadership decided to give Five Whys another
try. Fol owing the advice laid out in this chapter, they appointed a
Five Whys master named Tony Ford, a director of engineering. Tony was
an entrepreneur who had come to IGN</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	through
an acquisition. He got his start with Internet technology, building
websites about video games in the late 1990s. Eventual y that led to
an opportunity at a startup, TeamXbox, where he served as the lead
software developer. TeamXbox was acquired by IGN</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Entertainment
in 2003, and since that time Tony has been a technologist, leader of
innovation, and proponent of agile and lean practices there.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
Tony started without picking a narrow problem area on which to focus.
This led to early setbacks and frustration.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	area
on which to focus. This led to early setbacks and frustration.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Tony
relates, “As the new master I wasn’t very good at traversing
through the Five Whys e ectively, and the problems we were trying to
solve were not great candidates in the rst place. As you can imagine,
these early sessions were awkward and in the end not very useful. I
was get ing quite discouraged and frustrated.” This is a common
problem when one tries to tackle too much at once, but it is also a
consequence of the fact that these skil s take time to master.
Luckily, Tony persevered: “Having a Five Whys master is critical in
my opinion. Five Whys is easy in theory but di cult in practice, so
you need someone who knows it wel to shape the sessions for those who
don’t.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
turnaround came when Tony led a Five Whys session involving a project
that had been missing its deadlines. The session was fascinating and
insightful and produced meaningful proportional investments. Tony
explains: “The success had to do with a more experienced master and
more experienced at endees.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
al knew what the Five Whys was, and I did a real y good job keeping
us on track and away from tangents. This was a pivotal moment. Right
then I knew the Five Whys was a new tool that was going to have a
real impact on our overal success as a team and as a business.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	On
the surface, Five Whys seems to be about technical problems and
preventing mistakes, but as teams drive out these super cial wastes,
they develop a new understanding of how to work together.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Tony
put it this way: “I daresay that I discovered that the Five Whys
transcends root cause analysis by revealing information that brings
your team closer through a common understanding and perspective.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
lot of times a problem can pul people apart; Five Whys does the
opposite.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
asked Tony to provide an example of a recent successful Five Whys
analysis from IGN. His account of it is listed in the sidebar.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Without
the Five Whys, we would have never discovered al of the information
we did here. My guess is that we would have told that one developer
to not do stupid things on Friday nights and moved on. This is what I
emphasized earlier, where a good Five Whys session has two outputs,
learning and doing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
proportional investments that came out of this session are obviously
valuable, but the learnings are much more subtle, but amazing for
growing as developers and as a team.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	ADAPTING
TO SMALLER BATCHES</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Before
leaving the topic of building an adaptive organization, I want to
introduce one more story. This one concerns a product that you’ve
probably used if you’ve ever run your own business. It’s cal ed
QuickBooks, and it is one of Intuit’s flagship products.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	QuickBooks
has been the leading product in its category for many years. As a
result, it has a large and dedicated customer base, and Intuit
expects it to contribute signi cantly to its bot om line. Like most
personal computer (PC) software of the last two decades, QuickBooks
has been launched on an annual cycle, in one giant batch. This was
how it worked three years ago, when Greg Wright, the director of
product marketing for QuickBooks, joined the team.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
you can imagine, there were lots of existing processes in place to
ensure a consistent product and an on-time release. The typical
release approach was to spend signi cant up-front time to identify
the customers’ need:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Typical
y the rst three to four months of each annual cycle was spent
strategizing and planning, without building new features. Once a plan
and milestones were established, the team would spend the next six to
nine months building.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
would culminate in a big launch, and then the team would get its rst
feedback on whether it had successful y delivered on customers’
needs at the end of the process.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	So
here was the time line: start process in September, first beta
release is in June, second beta is in July. The beta is essential y
testing to make sure it doesn’t crash people’s computers or cause
them to lose their data—by that time in the process, only major
bugs can be xed. The design of the product itself is locked.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
is the standard “waterfal ” development methodology that product
development teams have used for years. It is a linear, large-batch
system that relies for success on proper forecasting and planning. In
other words, it is completely maladapted for today’s</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	planning.
In other words, it is completely maladapted for today’s rapidly
changing business environment.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Year
One: Achieving Failure</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Greg
witnessed this breakdown in 2009, his rst year on the QuickBooks
team. That year, the company shipped an entirely new system in
QuickBooks for online banking, one of its most important features.
The team went through rounds of usability testing using mock-ups and
nonfunctional prototypes, fol owed by signi cant beta testing using
sample customer data. At the moment of the launch, everything looked
good.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
rst beta release was in June, and customer feedback started coming in
negative. Although customers were complaining, there wasn’t su
cient cause to stop the release because it was technical y awless—it
didn’t crash computers. At that point, Greg was in a bind. He had
no way of knowing how the feedback would translate to real customer
behavior in the market. Were these just isolated complaints, or part
of a widespread problem? He did know one thing for sure, though: that
his team could not a ord to miss the deadline.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
the product nal y shipped, the results were terrible. It took
customers four to ve times longer to reconcile their banking
transactions than it had with the older version. In the end, Greg’s
team had failed to deliver on the customer need they were trying to
address (despite building the product to speci cation), and because
the next release had to go through the same waterfal process, it took
the team nine months to x. This is a classic case of “achieving
failure”—successful y executing a flawed plan.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Intuit
uses a tracking survey cal ed the Net Promoter Score2 to evaluate
customer satisfaction with its many products. This is a great source
of actionable metrics about what customers real y think about a
product. In fact, I used it at IMVU, too. One thing that is nice
about NPS is that it is very stable over time. Since it is measuring
core customer satisfaction, it is not subject to minor uctuations; it
registers only major changes in customer sentiment.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	uctuations;
it registers only major changes in customer sentiment.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	That
year, the QuickBooks score dropped 20 points, the rst time the
company had ever moved the needle with the Net Promoter Score. That
20-point drop resulted in significant losses for Intuit and was
embarrassing for the company—al because customer feedback came too
late in the process, al owing no time to iterate.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Intuit’s
senior management, including the general manager of the smal business
division and the head of smal business accounting, recognized the
need for change. To their credit, they tasked Greg with driving that
change. His mission: to achieve startup speed for the development and
deployment of QuickBooks.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Year
Two: Muscle Memory</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
next chapter of this story il ustrates how hard it is to build an
adaptive organization. Greg set out to change the QuickBooks
development process by using four principles: 1. Smal er teams. Shift
from large teams with uniform functional roles to smal er, ful y
engaged teams whose members take on dif erent roles.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
Achieve shorter cycle times.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
Faster customer feedback, testing both whether it crashes customers’
computers and the performance of new features/customer experience.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	4.
Enable and empower teams to make fast and courageous decisions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	On
the surface, these goals seem to be aligned with the methods and
principles described in previous chapters, but Greg’s second year
with QuickBooks was not a marked success. For example, he decreed
that the team would move to a midyear release milestone, e ectively
cut ing the cycle time and batch size in half. However, this was not
successful. Through sheer determination, the team tried valiantly to
get an alpha release out in January. However, the problems that a ict
large-batch development were stil present,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	problems
that a ict large-batch development were stil present, and the team
struggled to complete the alpha by April. That represented an
improvement over the past system because issues could be brought to
the surface two months earlier than under the old way, but it did not
produce the dramatical y bet er results Greg was looking for.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
fact, over the course of the year, the team’s process kept looking
more and more like it had in prior years. As Greg put it,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Organizations
have muscle memory,” and it is hard for people to unlearn old
habits. Greg was running up against a system, and making individual
changes such as arbitrarily changing the release date were no match
for it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Year
Three: Explosion</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Frustrated
by the limited progress in the previous year, Greg teamed up with the
product development leader Himanshu Baxi.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Together
they tossed out al the old processes. They made a public declaration
that their combined teams would be creating new processes and that
they were not going to go back to the old way.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead
of focusing on new deadlines, Greg and Himanshu invested in process,
product, and technology changes that enabled working in smal er
batches. Those technical innovations helped them get the desktop
product to customers faster for feedback.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Instead
of building a comprehensive road map at the beginning of the year,
Greg kicked o the year with what they cal ed idea/code/solution jams
that brought engineers, product managers, and customers together to
create a pipeline of ideas. It was scary for Greg as a product
manager to start the year without a de ned list of what would be in
the product release, but he had con dence in his team and the new
process.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
were three dif erences in year three:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	•
Teams were involved in creating new technologies, processes, and
systems.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	•
Cross-functional teams were formed around new great ideas.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	 
<img src="205812606c9480f20c08cca756509bf8_html_d8a50c703f7fe606.jpg" name="Image24" align="bottom" width="34" height="6" border="0"/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	•
Cross-functional teams were formed around new great ideas.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	•
Customers were involved from the inception of each feature concept.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It’s
important to understand that the old approach did not lack customer
feedback or customer involvement in the planning process. In the true
spirit of genchi gembutsu, Intuit product managers (PMs) would do
“fol ow-me-homes” with customers to identify problems to solve in
the next release. However, the PMs were responsible for al the
customer research. They would bring it back to the team and say,
“This is the problem we want to solve, and here are ideas for how
we could solve it.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Changing
to a cross-functional way of working was not smooth sailing. Some
team members were skeptical. For example, some product managers felt
that it was a waste of time for engineers to spend time in front of
customers. The PMs thought that their job was to gure out the
customer issue and de ne what needed to be built. Thus, the reaction
of some PMs to the change was: “What’s my job? What am I supposed
to be doing?” Similarly, some on the engineering side just wanted
to be told what to do; they didn’t want to talk to customers. As is
typical y the case in large-batch development, both groups had been
wil ing to sacri ce the team’s ability to learn in order to work
more “ef iciently.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Communication
was critical for this change process to succeed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Al
the team leaders were open about the change they were driving and why
they were driving it. Much of the skepticism they faced was based on
the fact that they did not have concrete examples of where this had
worked in the past; it was an entirely new process for Intuit. They
had to explain clearly why the old process didn’t work and why the
annual release “train” was not set ing them up for success.
Throughout the change they communicated the process outcomes they
were shooting for: earlier customer feedback and a faster development
cycle that was decoupled from the annual release time line. They
repeatedly emphasized that the new approach was how startup
competitors were working and iterating.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
had to fol ow suit or risk becoming irrelevant.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Historical
y, QuickBooks had been built with large teams and long cycle times.
For example, in earlier years the il -fated online banking team had
been composed of fteen engineers, seven quality assurance
specialists, a product manager, and at times more than one designer.
Now no team is bigger than ve people. The focus of each team is
iterating with customers as rapidly as possible, running experiments,
and then using validated learning to make real-time investment
decisions about what to work on. As a result, whereas they used to
have ve major “branches” of QuickBooks that merged features at
the time of the launch, now there are twenty to twenty- ve branches.
This al ows for a much larger set of experiments. Each team works on
a new feature for approximately six weeks end to end, testing it with
real customers throughout the process.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Although
the primary changes that are required in an adaptive organization are
in the mind-set of its employees, changing the culture is not su
cient. As we saw in Chapter 9, lean management requires treating work
as a system and then dealing with the batch size and cycle time of
the whole process. Thus, to achieve lasting change, the QuickBooks
team had to invest in tools and platform changes that would enable
the new, faster way of working.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, one of the major stress points in the at empt to release an
early alpha version the previous year was that QuickBooks is a
mission-critical product. Many smal businesses use it as their
primary repository for critical nancial data. The team was extremely
wary of releasing a minimum viable product that had any risk of
corrupting customer data. Therefore, even if they worked in smal er
teams with a smal er scope, the burden of al that risk would have
made it hard to work in smal er batches.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	To
get the batch size down, the QuickBooks team had to invest in new
technology. They built a virtualization system that al owed them to
run multiple versions of QuickBooks on a customer’s computer. The
second version could access al the customer’s data but could not
make permanent changes to it. Thus, there was no risk of the new
version corrupting the customer’s data by accident.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	risk
of the new version corrupting the customer’s data by accident.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
al owed them to isolate new releases to al ow selected real customers
to test them and provide feedback.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
results in year three were promising. The version of QuickBooks that
shipped that year had signi cantly higher customer satisfaction
ratings and sold more units. If you’re using QuickBooks right now,
odds are you are using a version that was built in smal batches. As
Greg heads into his fourth year with the QuickBooks team, they are
exploring even more ways to drive down batch size and cycle time. As
usual, there are possibilities that go beyond technical solutions.
For example, the annual sales cycle of boxed desktop software is a
signi cant barrier to truly rapid learning, and so the team has begun
experimenting with subscription-based products for the most active
customers. With customers downloading updates online, Intuit can
release software on a more frequent basis. Soon this program wil see
the QuickBooks team releasing to customers quarterly.3</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
Lean Startups grow, they can use adaptive techniques to develop more
complex processes without giving up their core advantage: speed
through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. In fact, one of the
primary bene ts of using techniques that are derived from lean
manufacturing is that Lean Startups, when they grow up, are wel
positioned to develop operational excel ence based on lean
principles. They already know how to operate with discipline, develop
processes that are tailor-made to their situation, and use lean
techniques such as the Five Whys and smal batches. As a successful
startup makes the transition to an established company, it wil be wel
poised to develop the kind of culture of disciplined execution that
characterizes the world’s best firms, such as Toyota.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
successful y growing into an established company is not the end of
the story. A startup’s work is never done, because as was discussed
in Chapter 2, even established companies must struggle to nd new
sources of growth through disruptive innovation. This imperative is

is coming earlier in companies’ lives. No longer can a successful
startup expect to have years after its initial public o ering to bask
in market-leading success. Today successful companies face immediate
pressure from new competitors, fast fol owers, and scrappy startups.
As a result, it no longer makes sense to think of startups as going
through discrete phases like the proverbial metamorphosis of a
caterpil ar to a but er y. Both successful startups and established
companies alike must learn to juggle multiple kinds of work at the
same time, pursuing operational excel ence and disruptive innovation.
This requires a new kind of portfolio thinking, which is the subject
of Chapter 12.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>INNOVATE</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Conventional
wisdom holds that when companies become larger, they inevitably lose
the capacity for innovation, creativity, and growth. I believe this
is wrong. As startups grow, entrepreneurs can build organizations
that learn how to balance the needs of existing customers with the
chal enges of nding new customers to serve, managing existing lines
of business, and exploring new business models—al at the same time.
And, if they are wil ing to change their management philosophy, I
believe even large, established companies can make this shift to what
I cal portfolio thinking.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>HOW
TO NURTURE DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Successful
innovation teams must be structured correctly in order to succeed.
Venture-backed and bootstrapped startups natural y have some of these
structural at ributes as a consequence of being smal , independent
companies. Internal startup teams require support from senior
management to create these structures. Internal or external, in my
experience startup teams require three structural at ributes: scarce
but secure resources, independent authority to develop their
business, and a personal stake in the outcome. Each of these
requirements is di erent from those of established company divisions.
Keep in mind that structure is merely a prerequisite—it does not
guarantee success. But get ing the structure wrong can lead to almost
certain failure.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Scarce
but Secure Resources Division leaders in large, established
organizations are adept at using politics to enlarge their budgets
but know that those budgets are somewhat loose. They often acquire as
large a budget as possible and prepare to defend it against
incursions from other departments. Politics means that they sometimes
win and sometimes lose: if a crisis emerges elsewhere in the
organization, their budget might suddenly be reduced by 10 percent.
This is not a catastrophe; teams wil have to work harder and do more
with less.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
likely, the budget has some padding in anticipation of this kind of
eventuality.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Startups
are di erent: too much budget is as harmful as too lit le</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	—as
countless dot-com failures can at est—and startups are extremely
sensitive to midcourse budgetary changes. It is extremely rare for a
stand-alone startup company to lose 10 percent of its cash on hand
suddenly. In a large number of cases, this would be a fatal blow, as
independent startups are run with lit le margin for error.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Thus,
startups are both easier and more demanding to run than traditional
divisions: they require much less capital overal , but that capital
must be absolutely secure from tampering.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Independent
Development Authority</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Startup
teams need complete autonomy to develop and market new products
within their limited mandate. They have to be able to conceive and
execute experiments without having to gain an excessive number of
approvals.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
strongly recommend that startup teams be completely cross-functional,
that is, have ful -time representation from every functional
department in the company that wil be involved in the creation or
launch of their early products. They have to be able to build and
ship actual functioning products and services, not just prototypes.
Hando s and approvals slow down the Build-Measure-</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	prototypes.
Hando s and approvals slow down the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop
and inhibit both learning and accountability.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Startups
require that they be kept to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Of
course, this level of development autonomy is liable to raise fears
in a parent organization. Al eviating those fears is a major goal of
the method recommended below.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
Personal Stake in the Outcome</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Third,
entrepreneurs need a personal stake in the outcome of their
creations. In stand-alone new ventures, this usual y is achieved
through stock options or other forms of equity ownership. Where a
bonus system must be used instead, the best incentives are tied to
the long-term performance of the new innovation.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
I do not believe that a personal stake has to be nancial. This is
especial y important in organizations, such as nonpro ts and
government, in which the innovation is not tied to nancial
objectives. In these cases, it is stil possible for teams to have a
personal stake. The parent organization has to make it clear who the
innovator is and make sure the innovator receives credit for having
brought the new product to life—if it is successful. As one
entrepreneur who ran her own division at a major media company told
me, “Financial incentives aside, I always felt that because my name
was on the door, I had more to lose and more to prove than someone
else. That sense of ownership is not insignificant.”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
formula is e ective in for-pro t companies as wel . At Toyota, the
manager in charge of developing a new vehicle from start to finish is
cal ed the shusa, or chief engineer: Shusa are often cal ed
heavy-weight project managers in the U.S. literature, but this name
understates their real roles as design leaders. Toyota employees
translate the term as chief engineer, and they refer to the vehicle
under development as the shusa’s car. They assured us that the
shusa has nal, absolute authority over every aspect of vehicle</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	absolute
authority over every aspect of vehicle development.1</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	On
the ip side, I know an extremely high-pro le technology company that
has a reputation for having an innovative culture, yet its track
record of producing new products is disappointing. The company boasts
an internal reward system that is based on large nancial and status
awards to teams that do something extraordinary, but those awards are
handed out by senior management on the basis of—no one knows what.
There are no objective criteria by which a team can gauge whether it
wil win this coveted lot ery. Teams have lit le con dence that they
wil receive any long-term ownership of their innovations. Thus, teams
rarely are motivated to take real risks, instead focusing their
energies on projects that are expected to win the approval of senior
management.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>CREATING
A PLATFORM FOR EXPERIMENTATION</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Next,
it is important to focus on establishing the ground rules under which
autonomous startup teams operate: how to protect the parent
organization, how to hold entrepreneurial managers accountable, and
how to reintegrate an innovation back into the parent organization if
it is successful. Recal the “island of freedom”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	that

the Parent Organization</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Conventional
y, advice about internal innovators focuses on protecting the startup
from the parent organization. I believe it is necessary to turn this
model on its head.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Let
me begin by describing a fairly typical meeting from one of my
consulting clients, a large company. Senior management had gathered
to make decisions about what to include in the next</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	gathered
to make decisions about what to include in the next version of its
product. As part of the company’s commitment to being data-driven,
it had tried to conduct an experiment on pricing.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
rst part of the meeting was taken up with interpreting the data from
the experiment.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	One
problem was that nobody could agree on what the data meant. Many
custom reports had been created for the meeting; the data warehouse
team was at the meeting too. The more they were asked to explain the
details of each row on the spreadsheet, the more evident it became
that nobody understood how those numbers had been derived. What we
were left looking at was the number of gross sales of the product at
a variety of di erent price points, broken down by quarter and by
customer segment. It was a lot of data to try to comprehend.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Worse,
nobody was sure which customers had been exposed to the experiment.
Di erent teams had been responsible for implementing it, and so di
erent parts of the product had been updated at di erent times. The
whole process had taken many months, and by this point, the people
who had conceived the experiment had been moved to a division
separate from that of the people who had executed it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	You
should be able to spot the many problems with this situation: the use
of vanity metrics instead of actionable metrics, an overly long cycle
time, the use of large batch sizes, an unclear growth hypothesis, a
weak experimental design, a lack of team ownership, and therefore
very lit le learning.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Listening
in, I assumed this would be the end of the meeting.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	With
no agreed-on facts to help make the decision, I thought nobody would
have any basis for making the case for a particular action. I was
wrong. Each department simply took whatever interpretation of the
data supported its position best and started advocating on its own
behalf. Other departments would chime in with alternative
interpretations that supported their positions, and so on. In the
end, decisions were not made based on data. Instead, the executive
running the meeting was forced to base decisions on the most
plausible-sounding arguments.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
seemed wasteful to me how much of the meeting had been</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
seemed wasteful to me how much of the meeting had been spent debating
the data because, in the end, the arguments that carried the day
could have been made right at the start. It was as if each advocate
sensed that he or she was about to be ambushed; if another team
managed to bring clarity to the situation, it might undermine that
person, and so the rational response was to obfuscate as much as
possible. What a waste.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Ironical
y, meetings like this had given data-driven decision making and
experimentation a bad name inside the company, and for good reason.
The data warehousing team was producing reports that nobody read or
understood. The project teams felt the experiments were a waste of
time, since they involved building features halfway, which meant they
were never any good. “Running an experiment” seemed to them to be
code for postponing a hard decision. Worst of al , the executive team
experienced the meetings as chronic headaches. Their old product
prioritization meetings might have been lit le more than a bat le of
opinions, but at least the executives understood what was going on.
Now they had to go through a ritual that involved complex math and
reached no de nite outcome, and then they ended up having a bat le of
opinions anyway.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Rational
Fears</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
at the heart of this departmental feud was a very rational fear. This
company served two customer segments: a business-to-business
enterprise segment and a consumer segment. In the B2B</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	segment,
the company employed sales sta to sel large volumes of the product to
other companies, whereas the consumer segment was driven mostly by
one-o purchases made by individuals. The bulk of the company’s
current revenue came from B2B sales, but growth in that segment had
been slowing. Everyone agreed there was tremendous potential for
growth in the consumer segment, but so far lit le had materialized.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Part
of the cause of this lack of growth was the current pricing
structure. Like many companies that sel to large enterprises, this</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	structure.
Like many companies that sel to large enterprises, this one published
a high list price and then provided heavy discounts to “favored”
corporate clients who bought in bulk. Natural y, every salesperson
was encouraged to make al of his or her clients feel favored.
Unfortunately, the published list price was much too high for the
consumer segment.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
team in charge of growing the consumer segment wanted to run
experiments with a lower price structure. The team in charge of the
enterprise segment was nervous that this would cannibalize or
otherwise diminish its existing relationships with its customers.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
if those customers discovered that individuals were get ing a lower
price than they were?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Anyone
who has been in a multisegment business wil recognize that there are
many possible solutions to this problem, such as creating tiered
feature sets so that di erent customers are able to purchase di erent
“levels” of the product (as in airline seating) or even
supporting dif erent products under separate brand names. Yet the
company was struggling to implement any of those solutions.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Why?
Out of fear of endangering the current business, each proposed
experiment would be delayed, sabotaged, and obfuscated.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It’s
important to emphasize that this fear is wel founded.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Sabotage
is a rational response from managers whose territory is threatened.
This company is not a random, tiny startup with nothing to lose. An
established company has a lot to lose. If the revenue from the core
business goes down, heads wil rol . This is not something to be taken
lightly.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Dangers of Hiding Innovation inside the Black Box The imperative to
innovate is unrelenting. Without the ability to experiment in a more
agile manner, this company eventual y would su er the fate described
in The Innovator’s Dilemma: ever-higher pro ts and margins year
after year until the business suddenly col apsed.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
often frame internal innovation chal enges by asking, How can we
protect the internal startup from the parent organization? I</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	can
we protect the internal startup from the parent organization? I would
like to reframe and reverse the question: How can we protect the
parent organization from the startup? In my experience, people defend
themselves when they feel threatened, and no innovation can ourish if
defensiveness is given free rein. In fact, this is why the common
suggestion to hide the innovation team is misguided. There are
examples of one-time successes using a secret skunkworks or o -site
innovation team, such as the building of the original IBM PC in Boca
Raton, Florida, completely separate from mainline IBM. But these
examples should serve mostly as cautionary tales, because they have
rarely led to sustainable innovation.2 Hiding from the parent
organization can have long-term negative consequences.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Consider
it from the point of view of the managers who have the innovation
sprung on them. They are likely to feel betrayed and more than a lit
le paranoid. After al , if something of this magnitude could be
hidden, what else is waiting in the shadows?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Over
time, this leads to more politics as managers are incentivized to
ferret out threats to their power, in uence, and careers. The fact
that the innovation was a success is no justi cation for this
dishonest behavior. From the point of view of established managers,
the message is clear: if you are not on the inside, you are liable to
be blindsided by this type of secret.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
is unfair to criticize these managers for their response; the
criticism should be aimed at senior executives who failed to design a
supportive system in which to operate and innovate. I believe this is
one reason why companies such as IBM lost their leadership position
in the new markets that they developed using a black box such as the
PC business; they are unable to re-create and sustain the culture
that led to the innovation in the first place.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Creating
an Innovation Sandbox</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
chal enge here is to create a mechanism for empowering innovation
teams out in the open. This is the path toward a sustainable culture
of innovation over time as companies face</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	sustainable
culture of innovation over time as companies face repeated
existential threats. My suggested solution is to create a sandbox for
innovation that wil contain the impact of the new innovation but not
constrain the methods of the startup team. It works as fol ows:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1.
Any team can create a true split-test experiment that a ects only the
sandboxed parts of the product or service (for a multipart product)
or only certain customer segments or territories (for a new product).
However:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2.
One team must see the whole experiment through from end to end.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3.
No experiment can run longer than a speci ed amount of time (usual y
a few weeks for simple feature experiments, longer for more
disruptive innovations).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	4.
No experiment can a ect more than a speci ed number of customers
(usual y expressed as a percentage of the company’s total
mainstream customer base).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	5.
Every experiment has to be evaluated on the basis of a single
standard report of five to ten (no more) actionable metrics.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	6.
Every team that works inside the sandbox and every product that is
built must use the same metrics to evaluate success.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	7.
Any team that creates an experiment must monitor the metrics and
customer reactions (support cal s, social media reaction, forum
threads, etc.) while the experiment is in progress and abort it if
something catastrophic happens.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	At
the beginning, the sandbox has to be quite smal . In the company
above, the sandbox initial y contained only the pricing page.
Depending on the types of products the company makes, the size of the
sandbox can be de ned in di erent ways. For example, an online
service might restrict it to certain pages or user ows. A retail
operation might restrict it to certain stores or geographic areas.
Companies trying to bring an entirely new product to market might
build the restriction around customers in certain segments.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unlike
in a concept test or market test, customers in the sandbox</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unlike
in a concept test or market test, customers in the sandbox are
considered real and the innovation team is al owed to at empt to
establish a long-term relationship with them. After al , they may be
experimenting with those early adopters for a long time before their
learning milestones are accomplished.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Whenever
possible, the innovation team should be cross-functional and have a
clear team leader, like the Toyota shusa. It should be empowered to
build, market, and deploy products or features in the sandbox without
prior approval. It should be required to report on the success or
failure of those e orts by using standard actionable metrics and
innovation accounting.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
approach can work even for teams that have never before worked
cross-functional y. The rst few changes, such as a price change, may
not require great engineering e ort, but they require coordination
across departments: engineering, marketing, customer service. Teams
that work this way are more productive as long as productivity is
measured by their ability to create customer value and not just stay
busy.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	True
experiments are easy to classify as successes or failures because
top-level metrics either move or they don’t. Either way, the team
learns immediately whether its assumptions about how customers wil
behave are correct. By using the same metrics each time, the team
builds literacy about those metrics across the company. Because the
innovation team is reporting on its progress by using the system of
innovation accounting described in Part Two, anyone who reads those
reports is get ing an implicit lesson in the power of actionable
metrics. This ef ect is extremely powerful. Even if someone wants to
sabotage the innovation team, he or she wil have to learn al about
actionable metrics and learning milestones to do it.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
sandbox also promotes rapid iteration. When people have a chance to
see a project through from end to end and the work is done in smal
batches and delivers a clear verdict quickly, they benefit from the
power of feedback. Each time they fail to move the numbers, they have
a real opportunity to act on their ndings immediately. Thus, these
teams tend to converge on optimal solutions rapidly even if they
start out with real y bad ideas.</p>

rapidly even if they start out with real y bad ideas.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
we saw earlier, this is a manifestation of the principle of smal
batches. Functional specialists, especial y those steeped in waterfal
or stage-gate development, have been trained to work in extremely
large batches. This causes even good ideas to get bogged down by
waste. By making the batch size smal , the sandbox method al ows
teams to make cheap mistakes quickly and start learning. As we’l
see below, these smal initial experiments can demonstrate that a team
has a viable new business that can be integrated back into the parent
company.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Holding
Internal Teams Accountable</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
already discussed learning milestones in detail in Chapter 7.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	With
an internal startup team, the sequence of accountability is the same:
build an ideal model of the desired disruption that is based on
customer archetypes, launch a minimum viable product to establish a
baseline, and then at empt to tune the engine to get it closer to the
ideal.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Operating
in this framework, internal teams essential y act as startups. As
they demonstrate success, they need to become integrated into the
company’s overal portfolio of products and services.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>CULTIVATING
THE MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
are four major kinds of work that companies must manage.3</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
an internal startup grows, the entrepreneurs who created the original
concept must tackle the chal enge of scale. As new mainstream
customers are acquired and new markets are conquered, the product
becomes part of the public face of the company, with important
implications for PR, marketing, sales, and business development. In
most cases, the product wil at ract competitors: copycats, fast fol
owers, and imitators of al stripes.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Once
the market for the new product is wel established,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Once
the market for the new product is wel established, procedures become
more routine. To combat the inevitable commoditization of the product
in its market, line extensions, incremental upgrades, and new forms
of marketing are essential. In this phase, operational excel ence
takes on a greater role, as an important way to increase margins is
to lower costs. This may require a di erent type of manager: one who
excels in optimization, delegation, control, and execution. Company
stock prices depend on this kind of predictable growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	There
is a fourth phase as wel , one dominated by operating costs and
legacy products. This is the domain of outsourcing, automation, and
cost reduction. Nonetheless, infrastructure is stil mission-critical.
Failure of facilities or important infrastructure or the abandonment
of loyal customers could derail the whole company.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
unlike the growth and optimization phase, investments in this area
wil not help the company achieve top-line growth.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Managers
of this kind of organization su er the fate of basebal umpires:
criticized when something goes wrong, unappreciated when things are
going wel .</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
tend to speak of these four phases of businesses from the perspective
of large companies, in which they may represent entire divisions and
hundreds or even thousands of people. That’s logical, as the
evolution of the business in these kinds of extreme cases is the
easiest to observe. However, al companies engage in al four phases of
work al the time. As soon as a product hits the marketplace, teams of
people work hard to advance it to the next phase. Every successful
product or feature began life in research and development (R&amp;D),
eventual y became a part of the company’s strategy, was subject to
optimization, and in time became old news.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
problem for startups and large companies alike is that employees
often fol ow the products they develop as they move from phase to
phase. A common practice is for the inventor of a new product or
feature to manage the subsequent resources, team, or division that
ultimately commercializes it. As a result, strong creative managers
wind up get ing stuck working on the growth and optimization of
products rather than creating new ones.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
tendency is one of the reasons established companies</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
tendency is one of the reasons established companies struggle to nd
creative managers to foster innovation in the rst place. Every new
innovation competes for resources with established projects, and one
of the scarcest resources is talent.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Entrepreneur
Is a Job Title</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
way out of this dilemma is to manage the four kinds of work di
erently, al owing strong cross-functional teams to develop around
each area. When products move from phase to phase, they are handed o
between teams. Employees can choose to move with the product as part
of the hando or stay behind and begin work on something new. Neither
choice is necessarily right or wrong; it depends on the temperament
and skil s of the person in question.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Some
people are natural inventors who prefer to work without the pressure
and expectations of the later business phases. Others are ambitious
and see innovation as a path toward senior management. Stil others
are particularly skil ed at the management of running an established
business, outsourcing, and bolstering e ciencies and wringing out
cost reductions. People should be al owed to find the kinds of jobs
that suit them best.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
fact, entrepreneurship should be considered a viable career path for
innovators inside large organizations. Managers who can lead teams by
using the Lean Startup methodology should not have to leave the
company to reap the rewards of their skil s or have to pretend to t
into the rigid hierarchies of established functional departments.
Instead, they should have a business card that says simply
“Entrepreneur” under the name. They should be held accountable
via the system of innovation accounting and promoted and rewarded
accordingly.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	After
an entrepreneur has incubated a product in the innovation sandbox, it
has to be reintegrated into the parent organization. A larger team
eventual y wil be needed to grow it, commercialize it, and scale it.
At rst, this team wil require the continued leadership of the
innovators who worked in the sandbox. In fact, this is a positive
part of the process in that it gives the innovators a chance</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	positive
part of the process in that it gives the innovators a chance to train
new team members in the new style of working that they mastered in
the original sandbox.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Ideal
y, the sandbox wil grow over time; that is, rather than move the team
out of the sandbox and into the company’s standard routines, there
may be opportunities to enlarge the scope of the sandbox. For
example, if only certain aspects of the product were subject to
experimentation in the sandbox, new features can be added. In the
online service described earlier, this could be accomplished by
starting with a sandbox that encompassed the product pricing page.
When those experiments succeeded, the company could add the website’s
home page to the sandbox. It subsequently might add the search
functionality or the overal web design. If only certain customers or
certain numbers of customers were targeted initial y, the product’s
reach could be increased.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	When
such changes are contemplated, it’s important that senior
management consider whether the teams working in the sandbox can fend
for themselves political y in the parent organization. The sandbox
was designed to protect them and the parent organization, and any
expansion needs to take this into account.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Working
in the innovation sandbox is like developing startup muscles. At rst,
the team wil be able to take on only modest experiments. The earliest
experiments may fail to produce much learning and may not lead to
scalable success. Over time, those teams are almost guaranteed to
improve as long as they get the constant feedback of smal -batch
development and actionable metrics and are held accountable to
learning milestones.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Of
course, any innovation system eventual y wil become the victim of its
own success. As the sandbox expands and the company’s revenue grows
as a result of the sandbox’s innovations, the cycle wil have to
begin again. The former innovators wil become guardians of the status
quo. When the product makes up the whole sandbox, it inevitably wil
become encumbered with the additional rules and controls needed for
mission-critical operation.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	New
innovation teams wil need a new sandbox within which to play.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Becoming
the Status Quo</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
last transition is especial y hard for innovators to accept: their
transformation from radical outsiders to the embodiment of the status
quo. I have found it disturbing in my career. As you can guess from
the techniques I advocate as part of the Lean Startup, I have always
been a bit of a troublemaker at the companies at which I have worked,
pushing for rapid iteration, data-driven decision making, and early
customer involvement. When these ideas were not part of the dominant
culture, it was simple (if frustrating) to be an advocate. Al I had
to do was push as hard as humanly possible for my ideas. Since the
dominant culture found them heretical, they would compromise with me
a “reasonable” amount. Thanks to the psychological phenomenon of
anchoring, this led to a perverse incentive: the more radical my
suggestion was, the more likely it was that the reasonable compromise
would be closer to my true goal.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Fast-forward
several years to when I was running product development. When we’d
hire new people, they had to be indoctrinated into the Lean Startup
culture. Split testing, continuous deployment, and customer testing
were al standard practice. I needed to continue to be a strong
advocate for my ideas, making sure each new employee was ready to
give them a try. But for the people who had been working there
awhile, those ideas had become part of the status quo.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Like
many entrepreneurs, I was caught between constant evangelizing for my
ideas and constantly entertaining suggestions for ways they could be
improved. My employees faced the same incentive I had exploited years
before: the more radical the suggestion is, the more likely it is
that the compromise wil move in the direction they desire. I heard it
al : suggestions that we go back to waterfal development, use more
quality assurance (QA), use less QA, have more or less customer
involvement, use more vision and less data, or interpret data in a
more statistical y rigorous way.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	way.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
took a constant e ort to consider these suggestions seriously.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	However,
responding dogmatical y is unhelpful. Compromising by automatical y
split ing the dif erence doesn’t work either.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I’ve
found that every suggestion should be subjected to the same rigorous
scienti c inquiry that led to the creation of the Lean Startup in the
rst place. Can we use the theory to predict the results of the
proposed change? Can we incubate the change in a smal team and see
what happens? Can we measure its impact?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Whenever
they could be implemented, these approaches have al owed me to
increase my own learning and, more important, the productivity of the
companies I have worked with. Many of the Lean Startup techniques
that we pioneered at IMVU are not my original contributions. Rather,
they were conceived, incubated, and executed by employees who brought
their own creativity and talent to the task.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Above
al , I faced this common question: How do we know that</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“your
way” of building a company wil work? What other companies are using
it? Who has become rich and famous as a result? These questions are
sensible. The titans of our industry are al working in a slower, more
linear way. Why are we doing something dif erent?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
is these questions that require the use of theory to answer.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Those
who look to adopt the Lean Startup as a de ned set of steps or
tactics wil not succeed. I had to learn this the hard way. In a
startup situation, things constantly go wrong. When that happens, we
face the age-old dilemma summarized by Deming: How do we know that
the problem is due to a special cause versus a systemic cause? If
we’re in the middle of adopting a new way of working, the
temptation wil always be to blame the new system for the problems
that arise. Sometimes that tendency is correct, sometimes not.
Learning to tel the di erence requires theory. You have to be able to
predict the outcome of the changes you make to tel if the problems
that result are real y problems.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
example, changing the de nition of productivity for a team from
functional excel ence—excel ence in marketing, sales, or product
development—to validated learning wil cause problems.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	product
development—to validated learning wil cause problems.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
was indicated earlier, functional specialists are accustomed to
measuring their e ciency by looking at the proportion of time they
are busy doing their work. A programmer expects to be coding al day
long, for example. That is why many traditional work environments
frustrate these experts: the constant interruption of meetings,
cross-functional hando s, and explanations for endless numbers of
bosses al act as a drag on e ciency. However, the individual e ciency
of these specialists is not the goal in a Lean Startup. Instead, we
want to force teams to work cross-functional y to achieve validated
learning. Many of the techniques for doing this</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	—actionable
metrics, continuous deployment, and the overal Build-Measure-Learn
feedback loop—necessarily cause teams to suboptimize for their
individual functions. It does not mat er how fast we can build. It
does not mat er how fast we can measure.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
mat ers is how fast we can get through the entire loop.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
my years teaching this system, I have noticed this pat ern every
time: switching to validated learning feels worse before it feels bet
er. That’s the case because the problems caused by the old system
tend to be intangible, whereas the problems of the new system are al
too tangible. Having the bene t of theory is the antidote to these
chal enges. If it is known that this loss of productivity is an
inevitable part of the transition, it can be managed actively.
Expectations can be set up front. In my consulting practice, for
example, I have learned to raise these issues from day one;
otherwise, they are liable to derail the whole e ort once it is under
way. As the change progresses, we can use the root cause analysis and
fast response techniques to gure out which problems need prevention.
Ultimately, the Lean Startup is a framework, not a blueprint of steps
to fol ow. It is designed to be adapted to the conditions of each
speci c company. Rather than copy what others have done, techniques
such as the Five Whys al ow you to build something that is perfectly
suited to your company.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
best way to achieve mastery of and explore these ideas is to embed
oneself in a community of practice. There is a thriving community of
Lean Startup meetups around the world as wel as</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	community

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	EPILOGUE:
WASTE NOT</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
year marks the one hundredth anniversary of Frederick Winslow
Taylor’s The Principles of Scienti c Management, rst published in
1911. The movement for scienti c management changed the course of the
twentieth century by making possible the tremendous prosperity that
we take for granted today. Taylor e ectively invented what we now
consider simply management: improving the e ciency of individual
workers, management by exception (focusing only on unexpectedly good
or bad results), standardizing work into tasks, the task-plus-bonus
system of compensation, and—above al —the idea that work can be
studied and improved through conscious e ort. Taylor invented modern
white-col ar work that sees companies as systems that must be managed
at more than the level of the individual. There is a reason al past
management revolutions have been led by engineers: management is
human systems engineering.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
1911 Taylor wrote: “In the past, the man has been rst; in the
future, the system must be rst.” Taylor’s prediction has come to
pass. We are living in the world he imagined. And yet, the revolution
that he unleashed has been—in many ways—too successful. Whereas
Taylor preached science as a way of thinking, many people confused
his message with the rigid techniques he advocated: time and motion
studies, the di erential piece-rate system, and—most gal ing of al
—the idea that workers should be treated as lit le more than
automatons. Many of these ideas proved extremely harmful and required
the e orts of later theorists and</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	extremely
harmful and required the e orts of later theorists and managers to
undo. Critical y, lean manufacturing rediscovered the wisdom and
initiative hidden in every factory worker and redirected Taylor’s
notion of e ciency away from the individual task and toward the
corporate organism as a whole. But each of these subsequent
revolutions has embraced Taylor’s core idea that work can be
studied scienti cal y and can be improved through a rigorous
experimental approach.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
the twenty- rst century, we face a new set of problems that Taylor
could not have imagined. Our productive capacity greatly exceeds our
ability to know what to build. Although there was a tremendous amount
of invention and innovation in the early twentieth century, most of
it was devoted to increasing the productivity of workers and machines
in order to feed, clothe, and house the world’s population.
Although that project is stil incomplete, as the mil ions who live in
poverty can at est, the solution to that problem is now strictly a
political one. We have the capacity to build almost anything we can
imagine. The big question of our time is not Can it be built? but
Should it be built? This places us in an unusual historical moment:
our future prosperity depends on the quality of our col ective
imaginations.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
1911, Taylor wrote:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
can see our forests vanishing, our water-powers going to waste, our
soil being carried by oods into the sea; and the end of our coal and
our iron is in sight. But our larger wastes of human e ort, which go
on every day through such of our acts as are blundering, il
-directed, or ine cient … are less visible, less tangible, and are
but vaguely appreciated.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
can see and feel the waste of material things.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Awkward,

visible or tangible behind them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Their

And for this reason, even though our daily loss from this source is
greater than from our waste of material things, the one has stirred
us deeply, while the</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	material
things, the one has stirred us deeply, while the other has moved us
but lit le.1</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
century on, what can we say about those words? On the one hand, they
feel archaic. We of the twenty- rst century are hyperaware of the
importance of e ciency and the economic value of productivity gains.
Our workplaces are—at least when it comes to the building of
material objects—incredibly wel organized compared with those of
Taylor’s day.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	On
the other hand, Taylor’s words strike me as completely
contemporary. For al of our vaunted e ciency in the making of things,
our economy is stil incredibly wasteful. This waste comes not from
the ine cient organization of work but rather from working on the
wrong things—and on an industrial scale. As Peter Drucker said,
“There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great ef
iciency what should not be done at al .”2</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	And
yet we are doing the wrong things e ciently al the time. It is hard
to come by a solid estimate of just how wasteful modern work is, but
there is no shortage of anecdotes. In my consulting and travels
talking about the Lean Startup, I hear the same message consistently
from employees of companies big and smal . In every industry we see
endless stories of failed launches, il -conceived projects, and
large-batch death spirals. I consider this misuse of people’s time
a criminal y negligent waste of human creativity and potential.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
percentage of al this waste is preventable? I think a much larger
proportion than we currently realize. Most people I meet believe that
in their industry at least, projects fail for good reasons: projects
are inherently risky, market conditions are unpredictable,</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“big
company people” are intrinsical y uncreative. Some believe that if
we just slowed everything down and used a more careful process, we
could reduce the failure rate by doing fewer projects of higher
quality. Others believe that certain people have an innate gift of
knowing the right thing to build. If we can nd enough of these
visionaries and virtuosos, our problems wil be solved. These</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“solutions”
were once considered state of the art in the nineteenth century, too,
before people knew about modern management.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	century,
too, before people knew about modern management.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
requirements of an ever-faster world make these antique approaches
unworkable, and so the blame for failed projects and businesses often
is heaped on senior management, which is asked to do the impossible.
Alternatively, the nger of blame is pointed at nancial investors or
the public markets for overemphasizing quick xes and short-term
results. We have plenty of blame to go around, but far too lit le
theory to guide the actions of leaders and investors alike.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	The
Lean Startup movement stands in contrast to this hand-wringing. We
believe that most forms of waste in innovation are preventable once
their causes are understood. Al that is required is that we change
our col ective mind-set concerning how this work is to be done.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
is insu cient to exhort workers to try harder. Our current problems
are caused by trying too hard—at the wrong things. By focusing on
functional e ciency, we lose sight of the real goal of innovation: to
learn that which is currently unknown. As Deming taught, what mat ers
is not set ing quantitative goals but xing the method by which those
goals are at ained. The Lean Startup movement stands for the
principle that the scienti c method can be brought to bear to answer
the most pressing innovation question: How can we build a sustainable
organization around a new set of products or services?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>ORGANIZATIONAL
SUPERPOWERS</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
participant at one of my workshops came up to me a few months
afterward to relate the fol owing story, which I am paraphrasing:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	“Knowing
Lean Startup principles makes me feel like I have superpowers. Even
though I’m just a junior employee, when I meet with corporate VPs
and GMs in my large company, I ask them simple questions and very
quickly help them see how their projects are based on fundamental
hypotheses that are testable. In minutes, I can lay out a plan they
could fol ow to scienti cal y validate their plans before it’s too
late. They consistently respond with ‘Wow, you</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	plans
before it’s too late. They consistently respond with ‘Wow, you
are bril iant. We’ve never thought to apply that level of rigor to
our thinking about new products before.’ ”</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
a result of these interactions, he has developed a reputation within
his large company as a bril iant employee. This has been good for his
career but very frustrating for him personal y. Why?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Because
although he is quite bril iant, his insights into awed product plans
are due not to his special intel igence but to having a theory that
al ows him to predict what wil happen and propose alternatives. He is
frustrated because the managers he is pitching his ideas to do not
see the system. They wrongly conclude that the key to success is
nding bril iant people like him to put on their teams.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	They
are failing to see the opportunity he is real y presenting them: to
achieve bet er results systematical y by changing their beliefs about
how innovation happens.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Like
Taylor before us, our chal enge is to persuade the managers of modern
corporations to put the system rst. However, Taylorism should act as
a cautionary tale, and it is important to learn the lessons of
history as we bring these new ideas to a more mainstream audience.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Taylor
is remembered for his focus on systematic practice rather than
individual bril iance. Here is the ful quote from The Principles of
Scienti c Management that includes the famous line about put ing the
system first:</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
the future it wil be appreciated that our leaders must be trained
right as wel as born right, and that no great man can (with the old
system of personal management) hope to compete with a number of
ordinary men who have been properly organized so as ef iciently to
cooperate.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
the past the man has been first; in the future the system must be
rst. This in no sense, however, implies that great men are not
needed. On the contrary, the rst object of any</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	men
are not needed. On the contrary, the rst object of any good system
must be that of developing rst-class men; and under systematic
management the best man rises to the top more certainly and more
rapidly than ever before.3</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Unfortunately,
Taylor’s insistence that scientific management does not stand in
opposition to nding and promoting the best individuals was quickly
forgot en. In fact, the productivity gains to be had through the
early scienti c management tactics, such as time and motion study,
task-plus-bonus, and especial y functional foremanship (the
forerunner of today’s functional departments), were so signi cant
that subsequent generations of managers lost sight of the importance
of the people who were implementing them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
has led to two problems: (1) business systems became overly rigid and
thereby failed to take advantage of the adaptability, creativity, and
wisdom of individual workers, and (2) there has been an overemphasis
on planning, prevention, and procedure, which enable organizations to
achieve consistent results in a mostly static world. On the factory
oor, these problems have been tackled head on by the lean
manufacturing movement, and those lessons have spread throughout many
modern corporations. And yet in new product development,
entrepreneurship, and innovation work in general we are stil using an
outdated framework.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	My
hope is that the Lean Startup movement wil not fal into the same
reductionist trap. We are just beginning to uncover the rules that
govern entrepreneurship, a method that can improve the odds of
startup success, and a systematic approach to building new and
innovative products. This in no way diminishes the traditional
entrepreneurial virtues: the primacy of vision, the wil ingness to
take bold risks, and the courage required in the face of overwhelming
odds. Our society needs the creativity and vision of entrepreneurs
more than ever. In fact, it is precisely because these are such
precious resources that we cannot af ord to waste them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Product
Development Pseudoscience</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
believe that if Taylor were alive today, he would chuckle at what
constitutes the management of entrepreneurs and innovators.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Although
we harness the labor of scientists and engineers who would have
dazzled any early-twentieth-century person with their feats of
technical wizardry, the management practices we use to organize them
are general y devoid of scienti c rigor. In fact, I would go so far
as to cal them pseudoscience.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
routinely green-light new projects more on the basis of intuition
than facts. As we’ve seen throughout this book, that is not the
root cause of the problem. Al innovation begins with vision. It’s
what happens next that is critical. As we’ve seen, too many
innovation teams engage in success theater, selectively nding data
that support their vision rather than exposing the elements of the
vision to true experiments, or, even worse, staying in stealth mode
to create a data-free zone for unlimited “experimentation” that
is devoid of customer feedback or external accountability of any
kind.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Anytime
a team at empts to demonstrate cause and e ect by placing highlights
on a graph of gross metrics, it is engaging in pseudoscience. How do
we know that the proposed cause and e ect is true? Anytime a team at
empts to justify its failures by resorting to learning as an excuse,
it is engaged in pseudoscience as wel .</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	If
learning has taken place in one iteration cycle, let us demonstrate
it by turning it into validated learning in the next cycle. Only by
building a model of customer behavior and then showing our ability to
use our product or service to change it over time can we establish
real facts about the validity of our vision.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Throughout
our celebration of the success of the Lean Startup movement, a note
of caution is essential. We cannot a ord to have our success breed a
new pseudoscience around pivots, MVPs, and the like. This was the
fate of scienti c management, and in the end, I believe, that set
back its cause by decades. Science came to stand for the victory of
routine work over creative work, mechanization over humanity, and
plans over agility. Later movements had to be spawned to correct
those deficiencies.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	spawned
to correct those deficiencies.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Taylor
believed in many things that he dubbed scienti c but that our modern
eyes perceive as mere prejudice. He believed in the inherent
superiority in both intel igence and character of aristocratic men
over the working classes and the superiority of men over women; he
also thought that lower-status people should be supervised strictly
by their bet ers. These beliefs are part and parcel of Taylor’s
time, and it is tempting to forgive him for having been blind to
them.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Yet
when our time is viewed through the lens of future practice, what
prejudices wil be revealed? In what forces do we place undue faith?
What might we risk losing sight of with this initial success of our
movement?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	It
is with these questions that I wish to close. As gratifying as it is
for me to see the Lean Startup movement gain fame and recognition, it
is far more important that we be right in our prescriptions. What is
known so far is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
is needed is a massive project to discover how to unlock the vast
stores of potential that are hidden in plain sight in our modern
workforce. If we stopped wasting people’s time, what would they do
with it? We have no real concept of what is possible.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Starting
in the late 1880s, Taylor began a program of experimentation to
discover the optimal way to cut steel. In the course of that
research, which lasted more than twenty- ve years, he and his col
eagues performed more than twenty thousand individual experiments.
What is remarkable about this project is that it had no academic
backing, no government R&amp;D budget. Its entire cost was paid by
industry out of the immediate pro ts generated from the higher
productivity the experiments enabled.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	This
was only one experimental program to uncover the hidden productivity
in just one kind of work. Other scienti c management disciples spent
years investigating bricklaying, farming, and even shoveling. They
were obsessed with learning the truth and were not satis ed with the
folk wisdom of craftspersons or the parables of experts.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Can
any of us imagine a modern knowledge-work manager with the same level
of interest in the methods his or her employees use?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	the
same level of interest in the methods his or her employees use?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	How
much of our current innovation work is guided by catchphrases that
lack a scientific foundation?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	A
New Research Program</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
comparable research programs could we be engaged in to discover how
to work more ef ectively?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
one thing, we have very lit le understanding of what stimulates
productivity under conditions of extreme uncertainty.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Luckily,
with cycle times fal ing everywhere, we have many opportunities to
test new approaches. Thus, I propose that we create startup testing
labs that could put al manner of product development methodologies to
the test.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	How
might those tests be conducted? We could bring in smal
cross-functional teams, perhaps beginning with product and
engineering, and have them work to solve problems by using di erent
development methodologies. We could begin with problems with clear
right answers, perhaps drawn from the many international programming
competitions that have developed databases of wel -de ned problems
with clear solutions. These competitions also provide a clear
baseline of how long it should take for various problems to be solved
so that we could establish clearly the individual problem-solving
prowess of the experimental subjects.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Using
this kind of setup for calibration, we could begin to vary the
conditions of the experiments. The chal enge wil be to increase the
level of uncertainty about what the right answer is while stil being
able to measure the quality of the outcome objectively.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Perhaps
we could use real-world customer problems and then have real
consumers test the output of the teams’ work. Or perhaps we could
go so far as to build minimum viable products for solving the same
set of problems over and over again to quantify which produces the
best customer conversion rates.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
also could vary the al -important cycle time by choosing more or less
complex development platforms and distribution channels to</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	or
less complex development platforms and distribution channels to test
the impact of those factors on the true productivity of the teams.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most
of al , we need to develop clear methods for holding teams
accountable for validated learning. I have proposed one method in
this book: innovation accounting using a wel -de ned financial model
and engine of growth. However, it is naive to assume that this is the
best possible method. As it is adopted in more and more companies,
undoubtedly new techniques wil be suggested, and we need to be able
to evaluate the new ideas as rigorously as possible.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Al
these questions raise the possibilities of public-private
partnerships between research universities and the entrepreneurial
communities they seek to foster. It also suggests that universities
may be able to add value in more ways than by being simply nancial
investors or creators of startup incubators, as is the current trend.
My prediction is that wherever this research is conducted wil become
an epicenter of new entrepreneurial practice, and universities
conducting this research therefore may be able to achieve a much
higher level of commercialization of their basic research
activities.4</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>THE
LONG-TERM STOCK EXCHANGE</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Beyond
simple research, I believe our goal should be to change the entire
ecosystem of entrepreneurship. Too much of our startup industry has
devolved into a feeder system for giant media companies and
investment banks. Part of the reason established companies struggle
to invest consistently in innovation is intense pressure from public
markets to hit short-term pro tability and growth targets. Mostly,
this is a consequence of the accounting methods we have developed for
evaluating managers, which focus on the kinds of gross “vanity”
metrics discussed in Chapter 7. What is needed is a new kind of stock
exchange, designed to trade in the stocks of companies that are
organized to sustain long-term thinking. I propose that we create a
Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	(LTSE).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	In
addition to quarterly reports on pro ts and margins, companies on the
LTSE would report using innovation accounting on their internal
entrepreneurship e orts. Like Intuit, they would report on the
revenue they were generating from products that did not exist a few
years earlier. Executive compensation in LTSE</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	companies
would be tied to the company’s long-term performance.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Trading
on the LTSE would have much higher transaction costs and fees to
minimize day trading and massive price swings. In exchange, LTSE
companies would be al owed to structure their corporate governance to
facilitate greater freedom for management to pursue long-term
investments. In addition to support for long-term thinking, the
transparency of the LTSE wil provide valuable data about how to
nurture innovation in the real world. Something like the LTSE would
accelerate the creation of the next generation of great companies,
built from the ground up for continuous innovation.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	<b>IN
CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
a movement, the Lean Startup must avoid doctrines and rigid ideology.
We must avoid the caricature that science means formula or a lack of
humanity in work. In fact, science is one of humanity’s most
creative pursuits. I believe that applying it to entrepreneurship wil
unlock a vast storehouse of human potential.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	What
would an organization look like if al of its employees were armed
with Lean Startup organizational superpowers?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For
one thing, everyone would insist that assumptions be stated
explicitly and tested rigorously not as a stal ing tactic or a form
of make-work but out of a genuine desire to discover the truth that
underlies every project’s vision.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
would not waste time on endless arguments between the defenders of
quality and the cowboys of reckless advance; instead, we would
recognize that speed and quality are al ies in the pursuit of the
customer’s long-term bene t. We would race to test our vision but
not to abandon it. We would look to eliminate waste not</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	vision
but not to abandon it. We would look to eliminate waste not to build
quality castles in the sky but in the service of agility and
breakthrough business results.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	We
would respond to failures and setbacks with honesty and learning, not
with recriminations and blame. More than that, we would shun the
impulse to slow down, increase batch size, and indulge in the curse
of prevention. Instead, we would achieve speed by bypassing the
excess work that does not lead to learning. We would dedicate
ourselves to the creation of new institutions with a long-term
mission to build sustainable value and change the world for the bet
er.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Most

Business architecture is a concept explored in detail in Moore’s
Dealing with Darwin. “Organizational structure based on
prioritizing one of two business models (Complex systems model and
Volume operations model). Innovation types are understood and
executed in completely di erent ways depending on which model an
enterprise adopts.” For more, see ht

If you’re having trouble accepting this fact, it real y is helpful
to watch it on video. One extremely detail-oriented blogger took one
video and broke it down, second-by-second, to see where the time
went: “You lose between 2 and 5 seconds every time you move the
pile around between steps. Also, you have to</p>

move the pile around between steps. Also, you have to manage the pile
several times during a task, something you don’t have to do nearly
as much with [single-piece ow]. This also has a factory corol ary:
storing, moving, retrieving, and looking for work in progress
inventory.” See the rest of the commentary</p>

owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the many people who have helped
make The Lean Startup a reality. First and foremost are the thousands
of entrepreneurs around the world who have tested these ideas, chal
enged them, re ned them, and improved them. Without their
relentless—and mostly unheralded—work every day, none of this
would be possible. Thank you.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	Real
startups involve failure, embarrassing mistakes, and constant chaos.
In my research for this book, I discovered that most entrepreneurs
and managers would prefer not to have the real story of their daily
work told in public. Therefore, I am indebted to the courageous
entrepreneurs who consented to have their stories told, many of whom
spent hours in tedious interviews and fact-checking conversations.
Thank you.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I
have been grateful throughout my career to have mentors and col
aborators who have pushed me to accomplish more than I could have on
my own. Wil Harvey is responsible for both recruiting me to Silicon
Val ey in the rst place and for trusting me with the opportunity to
try out many of these ideas for the rst time at IMVU. I am grateful
to my other IMVU cofounders Marcus Gosling, Mat Danzig, and Mel
Guymon as wel as the many IMVU</p>

and Jason Altieri for their help along the way.</p>

Clavier (SoftTech VC).</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	As
you can imagine, this book involved a tremendous amount of feedback,

Mark Graban, Jennifer Carolan, Manuel Rosso, Tim O’Reil y, and Reid

know it is a cliché to say, “None of this would have been possible
without the constant support of my loving family.” But in this

Ries, have always supported my love of technology while stil
insisting on the importance of a liberal arts education. Without
their constant love and support, I would never have had the courage
to step into the void of entrepreneurship or have found my own voice
as a writer. I know my grandparents have been with me every step of
this journey—they believed deeply in the power of writing and took
supreme joy in my sisters’ and my every accomplishment. To my

thank you for supporting me al these years.</p>
